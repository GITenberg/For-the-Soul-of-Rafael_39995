</div>
<p>Over the valley of the Mission
of the Tragedies, the grass was
knee-deep in March that year.
The horses galloping from the
mesa trail down to Boca de la
Playa (the mouth of the ocean)
were fat and sleek and tricky as
they ran neck and neck past the corral of the little
plain, and splashed in glee through the San Juan
River, where it ends its short run from the Sierras to
the Pacific.</p>

<p>Where the west trail hugged the hill, two men sat
their broncos, watching that no strays break for the
mesa above; and beyond the cross on Avila's hill, other
vaqueros guarded El Camino Real (the road royal),
lest in the whirl and dash of the round-up rebels
might break for the open and a stampede undo all the
riding since dawn of day.</p>

<p>High above on the western cliff a giant head of
cactus reared infernal arms and luminous bloom.
One immense clump threw a shadow across the cliff
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
road where it leaves the river plain and winds along the
cañon to the mesa above the sea,&mdash;the road over
which in the old days the Mission Indians bore hides
to the ships and flung them from the cliffs to the
waiting boats below.</p>

<p>A man stood back of the cactus watching with tireless
eyes the dividing of the herds and the quick
work of the vaqueros as their excited mustangs raced
for a stray or a rebel from the ranks. A dark serape
was at his feet, the dust of the roads on his face, and
when he removed his sombrero to light a cigarro in its
shelter, there was disclosed a great shock of black hair
worn unusually long, and matching in unkemptness
the full beard covering his face almost to his black
velvety eyes.</p>

<p>They were the one youthful feature in an otherwise
weather-worn visage, and at the sound of horse hoofs
on the road, they opened wider, listening, alert, yet he
did not turn to look whence the sounds came. Instead,
he dropped silently to the serape, crushed the end of
the cigarro against a cactus leaf, and waited, as still and
as safe from detection as a lizard of the mesa in a sage
thicket.</p>

<p>He could see clearly the face of Don Antonio, the
major-domo, and instinctively his right hand reached
for his gun. Then he shrugged his shoulders at his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
own folly, and bent his head to listen. Don Antonio
was speaking Americano to a man riding beside him,
and the man behind the cactus frowned impatiently,&mdash;the
villanous tongue was an added grievance. A few
rebellious animals had made a dash for the cliff, and
Don Antonio waved his sombrero and ranged his
horse across the road. His companion did the same,
and to give the vaqueros time to cross the river after
them, the two stood guard in the shadow of the
cactus, and rolled cigarros and smoked leisurely, while
the horsemen, in jingling spurs and all the bravery of
the Mexican riders' outfit, circled and lassoed the pick
of the herd for the Apache work of the government
in the desert lands.</p>

<p>"It is quicker done than it was a year ago," the
American remarked approvingly, "and the horses are
in better condition. If you can let us have the five
hundred from the La Paz ranges, there should be no
trouble about making up the other five hundred from
the San Mateo."</p>

<p>"Not any, señor," agreed Don Antonio, "I send
a man down to have them round-up for next week.
You no want that they begin sooner than that?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow," returned the other with smiling
decision.</p>

<p>"To-morrow! Holy Maria and José! You will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
cut out the fiesta and the barbecue always given for
the army men? Señor Bryton, the Don Miguel and
Don Rafael Arteaga will feel offend if you refuse their
hospitality except for the little&mdash;little while, the horse
herd is arranged for."</p>

<p>"Sorry to offend the young men," observed the
other. "But since Don Miguel is ranging in some
other part of California, and your Don Rafael is in
Mexico getting married or making love,&mdash;which is
it?&mdash;I reckon they will not miss us much."</p>

<p>"No, señor, it is not to marry down there, only to
make it all arrange. His mother, the Doña Luisa, is
there in Mexico since San Pascual; but Doña Luisa
will be more old and crippled than she is now, before
she lets Don Rafael be marry outside her own Mission."</p>

<p>"So they come back here for the ceremony?"</p>

<p>"Sure! Doña Luisa she marry Don Vicente, here
in San Juan Capistrano. It is here he have the big
trouble with the padre, and the padre put the curse
on him that long time ago. It is here that he is
brought back dead from San Pascual. And now when
the sons have make much trouble, all are dead but
two, and when Doña Luisa, who was so proud, has
only Indian grandchildren, she wants to marry Rafael
to a señorita who is half a nun, that the curse may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
lifted. She think that girl do more to keep him
from walking in Miguel's shoes than prayers to the
saints can do; and it may be,&mdash;who knows? I hear
you talking of the padre's curse to the Alcalde, so I
know you hearing the story."</p>

<p>"Um&mdash;something of church property south of
here, wasn't it?" remarked the American. "Yes, I
remember. There goes a mare that is a beauty for a
mustang."</p>

<p>"Some few years, and you no getting that strong,
wild stock some more," he observed. "Miguel and
Rafael want English stallions and such other breeds.
They will have English stock and American customs.
The saints keep Doña Luisa from hearing them all. I
mean no discourtesy, señor, but she is an old woman
now, and left her home because she would not live in
your government. She comes back for duty and the
marriage; but the old never change, señor, and she is
hating it till she die."</p>

<p>The American cast his eyes northward where the
heights of San Jacinto stood guard over the beautiful
valley. Willows marked the course of Trabuco Creek
and San Juan River, and on the plateau between them
gleamed the ruined dome of the old mission, a remnant
of beauty such as the ranging American meets
with in Latin lands, seldom in his own, and admires,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and wonders if it was worth while, and drifts away
again, but never quite forgets.</p>

<p>Yellow-white it gleamed like an opal in a setting of
velvety ranges under turquoise skies. About its walls
were the clustered adobes of the Mexicans, like children
creeping close to the feet of the one mother; and
beyond that the illimitable ranges of mesa and valley,
of live-oak groves and knee-deep meadows, of countless
springs and cañons of mystery, whence gold was
washed in the freshets; and over all, eloquent, insistent,
appealing, the note of the meadow-lark cutting clearly
through the hoof-beats of the herd and the calls of the
vaqueros.</p>

<p>"I think I should hate it, too," he said at last.
"They lived like kings and made their own laws in
those days. After being a queen of all this, it would
be hard to be subject to new forms."</p>

<p>"That is it, señor, she never get used to like the
American flag. That why she want always that Don
Rafael marry South, a good Catholic, and a señorita
of Mexico. She only living for that, they say. Now
when it is done she die in peace."</p>

<p>"And Rafael, how will he manage his American
deals when&mdash;"</p>

<p>Don Antonio shrugged his shoulders doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Who knows? I glad I living my young life in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
other days. The fences have make ruin of the country
in the north; after a while it is down here all the same.
All cut up in little gardens. Who knows?"</p>

<p>The American restrained a smile as he thought of
the sixty-five miles they had ridden across, and only one
little German colony where fence or hedges were in
evidence. For the rest all was fenced on the east by
the mountains and on the west by the sea. On the
north the Santa Barbara range would perhaps serve as
a barricade, and south even the Mexican line raised
no obstacle to roving herds.</p>

<p>"The fences will not come in our day, and it is all
now to be a pleasure ground for your gay Don Rafael."</p>

<p>"Not so much of a pleasure ground as it looks,
señor," observed Don Antonio dryly. "The same
curse works still. It is good he marries a convent
girl; it takes the prayers of Doña Luisa, and a saint
besides, to clear these ranges of Barto Nordico, el
Capitan."</p>

<p>The man on the serape shrugged his shoulders and
lifted his head, resting it on his hands to listen better.</p>

<p>"Nordico? Oh, yes! the man with an eye for
good horses."</p>

<p>"If it were only an eye," grumbled Don Antonio,
"but the devil seems to have a hundred hands, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
his reata touches only the first stock on the Arteaga
ranches."</p>

<p>"Not only the Arteagas', I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you not hearing that?" and the older man's
tone expressed surprise. "It going with the curse,
maybe, we not knowing. Old Don Vicente have the
brother Ramon, but Vicente buy up all Ramon's
land some way. Ramon goes crazy mad, <i>loco</i>, on that
account. And then his son, Barto, he study for the
priest, that is when the war comes, and he is only little
yet. He running away from school to fight; but all
he can do is to carry the letters, he is so little and can
ride so like the devil. He never is content to the
American flags, no more than Doña Luisa, so he just
keeping on to fight, and the government no getting
him."</p>

<p>"Do they try?" asked the American.</p>

<p>"Do they&mdash;do they try? Since he joined Juan
Flores, one dozen men in Capistrano have the sword
cut or the bullet mark, who have gone to try for that
reward. It is good money, but no one getting it. He
is a devil."</p>

<p>"But I don't understand. You make him out an
Arteaga, yet he is called Nordico?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he hating the Arteagas, so he taking his
mother's name. He take the government mail
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
sometimes, and he takes the Arteaga horses always,
and no one ever finds him any place. While men
follow his trail for the mountains, he is out in a boat
on the sea. The saints send that he does not meet
the marriage gifts of Don Rafael."</p>

<p>The man behind the cactus fairly held his breath.</p>

<p>"Whew! would he attack the Mission or the town?"</p>

<p>"It would not be the first time," returned Antonio,
"but it is of the bride-chests on the journey that I
speak. Sixty miles of land they must cover from San
Diego, and they cost more than a herd of horses."</p>

<p>"Rafael can replace the gifts," observed the American,
"so long as his bandit cousin does not kidnap
the bride; but even that, I suppose, might be done in
this land of lonely ranges."</p>

<p>The man under the cactus nodded and showed his
teeth in an appreciative smile. He had met good fortune
for his long vigil; it was a day of luck, and he
crossed himself.</p>

<p>The vaqueros had circled the rebellious animals,
and headed them back.</p>

<p>"It is true, the horses are in better condition this
year," conceded the major-domo as they watched the
horses loping along the river side. "Do you send
them all together, or by the five hundred, across the
range, Señor Bryton?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
</p>

<p>"By the five hundred, I think the lieutenant
said," replied Bryton. "It is not easy to feed more
in one bunch on the journey."</p>

<p>The man behind the cactus arose stealthily and
stretched his arms as the hoof-beats grew more faint.</p>

<p>"Señor Bryton&mdash;eh?" and he shrugged his
shoulders contentedly. "The clever Bryton who put
us off the track last year and took the stock by the
north! This time he will not be so clever. Still, he
gives a man ideas in the head,&mdash;may he have an easy
death for that! Rafael's good friend who picks the
good horses for the good government!"

<p>"Men make plans, and the devil
makes other plans&mdash;and the
devil's plan has always the luck
with it."</p>

<p>Don Antonio had expressed
himself thus to the army men,
who fumed and fretted at delays
incident to the funeral ceremonies of Miguel Arteaga,
for whom the Mission bells clanged in the gray of a
morning, and the word went out that he lay trampled
into the dust of the Santa Ana ranch. A thousand
head of stampeding cattle had gone over him, and the
younger brother&mdash;the handsome Rafael&mdash;was now
the head of the Arteaga family. And with half the
horses selected for the government, the work had
stopped short. There was no head to anything
now until Rafael arrived. In vain the army men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
swore, and went farther south to secure mounts for the
regiment. They had to come back to San Juan, and
then it was that Keith Bryton, with his knowledge of
the people and of the country, came to their aid.</p>

<p>He heard that the debonair Rafael had landed at San
Pedro the day of the death, and had quietly lost himself
from the dismal ceremonies awaiting him in his
own province. Miguel could not be seen; what use
was it to witness the howling mob of Indian retainers?</p>

<p>Bryton, knowing something and surmising more of
the situation, held the army men with some promise to
"fix things," and secretly despatched a trusted vaquero
with a letter to San Pedro, allowing the new heir for
his return just the time necessary for the next ship
to come into the harbor, and the extra day's drive
from Los Angeles. In the meantime a personal letter
giving orders to Don Antonio to hand over the stock
as per contract was needed badly in San Juan, if Don
Rafael ever cared again for government favors.</p>

<p>The vaquero rode back in forty-eight hours with the
order. The work of rounding-up began over again,
and only Keith Bryton and Don Antonio knew how
it had come about.</p>

<p>Slowly affairs began to assume their usual routine.
People began to talk of other things; and only Doña
Teresa, the widow of Miguel, continued to go daily to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the dark old chapel back of the Mission dining-room,
and kneel in prayer before the wooden saints in the
niches. She sat in the patio of Juan Alvara's house,
and stared listlessly from one square of tiling in the
pavement to another. The priest had just left her after
the perfunctory words of solace, and was refreshing
himself with a glass of brandy preparatory to a game
of <i>malilla</i>. The week had been one of trial; it always is
so when the death is one of accident&mdash;no one is ready.</p>

<p>The Doña Teresa had been a pretty girl in the days
when Miguel Arteaga serenaded her endlessly, and her
family had insisted that the marriage should not be
postponed to add to their sleepless nights. One year&mdash;two
years, and the serenades were a thing of a former
life, and so was fat Teresa's beauty. From the willows
was brought again the Indian girl whose two children
had been christened in his name. She looked after
the servants who cooked for the vaqueros. Her manner
was ever quiet and submissive to Doña Teresa, who
accepted her as better than any of the others of the
same class. Doña Teresa had no children, and envied
though she was not jealous of Aguada of the smoke-black
eyes and the babies. And it was Aguada who
came to Doña Teresa in the patio, undid her bonnet-strings,
and bathed her face and hands with cool water.</p>

<p>Past the veranda of Juan Alvara, at San Juan, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the world of Southern California found its way.
There was a tavern down the street, where the stages
stopped between Los Angeles and San Diego, but Juan
Alvara's house was the one dwelling where distinguished
travellers were entertained, after the hospitality
of the padres at the Mission was a thing of the past.
It was up to this veranda Keith Bryton rode from the
second round-up at Boca de la Playa. He was tired
and dusty, and accepted gratefully the wine for which
the old man sent when he saw his guest approaching.</p>

<p>Alvara did not usually like "Gringos"; but at the
time the Juan Flores bandits were holding up the town
for ransom, it was Keith Bryton who had gathered a posse
of men, including the sheriff, and headed them again
for San Juan. Grain-sacks were piled along the roof
of the Mission as a barricade, and behind them some
riflemen guarded, as best they could, the several families
who had fled to the walls of the church for protection.</p>

<p>Only one store had been burned, and one store-keeper
killed, when the help came&mdash;thanks to Bryton,
and that one ride broke down all barriers for the
young Gringo in San Juan. He now never rode past
Alvara's veranda without a halt for a glass of wine, or
a chat, or even that best test of understanding, a rest
in silence together, looking out across the river to the
blue shadows of the hills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
This day as the young man sat smoking in such
silence, viewing idly the passing Indians whose dark
faces were lit by the rosy glow of the lowering sun,
and watching the circling doves whose white wings
caught flashes of pink from pink clouds above, the
older man, regarding his thoughtful face, asked after
a quiet interval, "What is it, my friend?"</p>

<p>The handsome bronzed young fellow stretched
wide his arms with a great sigh, and laughed shortly.</p>

<p>"Foolishness, Don Juan, much foolishness. I was
homesick for a something I never knew, so I left Los
Angeles and came here to find it. Can you understand
so crazy a thing as that?"</p>

<p>The old man nodded slowly.</p>

<p>"It is a girl&mdash;no?"</p>

<p>The young man laughed again, without mirth.</p>

<p>"Which of them?" and Bryton made a gesture
toward a group of dark faces across the plaza.
"There is pretty Lizetta, Teresa; and if one wants
the other sort, there is Chola Martina staring at us
both under her mantilla."</p>

<p>"It is you she stares at. The Lieutenant danced
with her last night. He is just off the ranges, so she
is to-day crazy over the Americanos. No&mdash;it is not
any of such girls you are for."</p>

<p>"I reckon not," agreed the young fellow. "I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
it is just the atmosphere, and perhaps the old monastery.
The pictures of Mexican towns paint themselves
on the memory and stay there. Were you
ever in Old Mexico, Don Juan?"</p>

<p>"Not I; never have I been a travelled man. But you&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I was down there a year ago," answered Bryton,
looking hard at the hills. "I found a town in a valley
like this,&mdash;there were just the same sort of 'dobes, and
the same sort of big church walls,&mdash;only it was a nuns'
cloister, instead of a deserted monastery."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I'll never go back, but&mdash;I'll never forget it!
That old broken wall, and Moorish chimney, and
the doves&mdash;they all belong to the same sort of picture.
I come here to sit and moon over them once
in a while, that's all!"</p>

<p>The old man regarded him with shrewd, kindly
eyes. He had the strain of Spanish blood, condoning
many follies of youth.</p>

<p>"So!" he said, kindly. "Thou comest here to
dance with the girls of San Juan, that the other girl
may be forgotten? Ai&mdash;yi!&mdash;these other sweethearts
are fellows who make much trouble!&mdash;so?"</p>

<p>"It is something more than a sweetheart keeps
me away," remarked the young fellow after a slight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
pause. "A mere sweetheart is not such a barricade;
most of us are perverse enough to think it rather an
incentive."</p>

<p>"You too, my friend?"</p>

<p>"Who knows?"</p>

<p>The old man puffed out another cigaretto and
threw the stump away before he spoke.</p>

<p>"The wives of other men it is wise to go clear of,
my friend."</p>

<p>Keith laughed more than the remark called for; in
fact, his amusement dispelled the murky thoughts by
which he had been driven to the hospitable veranda.</p>

<p>"True&mdash;very true; but which of us is always wise?"</p>

<p>Alvara made no reply to this, only shook his head,
and the other, noting the perplexity of it, chuckled.</p>

<p>"Don't lose sleep over my depravity," he suggested.
"I am no blacker than the rest of the sheep."</p>

<p>"Even then thou wouldst fall far short of whiteness,"
remarked the older man. "The padre swears
that San Juan will have worse than earthquakes if
there is no reform."</p>

<p>"That is bad," said Keith, with owl-like gravity.</p>

<p>"It is bad, señor&mdash;and it is true. I heard him say
it but an hour ago. He was playing <i>malilla</i> with old
Henrico and won three pesos. He says it is wrong to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
race horses on Sunday, since José went under and had
his neck broke. José, like Miguel, had not confessed,
and the padre wants money for a mass."</p>

<p>"Will he get it?"</p>

<p>"Sure. The boys will not see him stay in purgatory
for thirty pesos. They are throwing dice at
Don Eduardo's now, to see who will pay."</p>

<p>"If it was the horse of Don Eduardo, and José had
ridden for him ten years, why cannot Don Eduardo
pay?"</p>

<p>"Don Eduardo is English. The Englishmen are
used to going to hell."</p>

<p>"They would deserve to go for that, if for nothing
else," commented Bryton, as the report of a blast
shook the ground, and across the plaza the air was
filled with flying rock and brick and plaster; and then
a great cloud of dust drifted upward as the Mexican
workmen strolled back to their task of tearing down
the old church of San Juan Capistrano, whose massive
stone walls it had taken the padres and their
neophytes so many years of toil to complete.</p>

<p>"Not a church equal to it in the Californias; not a
church equal to it dreamed of in the States when it
was being built!" and the young fellow stared moodily
at the devastation of it. "Can't the bishop stop
that?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
"Ten years the Church fight to get it back. They
must win some day&mdash;oh, yes&mdash;sure!"</p>

<p>"But what will they have when the suit is won, if
this is allowed to go on?"</p>

<p>"Who knows?" queried Alvara, placidly. "We
may be in our graves, señor, and not here to see it.
When Eduardo wants foundation for an adobe, he
blows down a stone wall; when he wants walls for a
well, he blows down the arches of the patio, until bricks
enough fall. It is quicker than to burn new ones."</p>

<p>"But the padre?"</p>

<p>"There is the man who is padre of San Juan
Capistrano in these days," said Juan Alvara, briefly.</p>

<p>A man was coming up the middle of the road, his
boots wet and muddy from irrigating-ditches, a short
black pipe between his teeth. He halted to chaffer
with an Indian woman who carried a basket of fish
from the sea.</p>

<p>Contemptuously viewing the modest sea bass, he
said: "Fish only a foot long&mdash;what good are they?
Who is fool enough to buy such?"</p>

<p>"It is not to sell, father. Tia Concepcion, who is
much sick, ask for these; they are to give, for she is
sick."</p>

<p>"Humph! a sick woman to eat ten fish! They
will be sending for me in the middle of the night for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
prayers. You go to my cook, and leave seven of
these with him in the kitchen for my supper."</p>

<p>The Indian lowered her head and passed on to the
Mission. The padre crossed the plaza to where the
group of girls stood chatting at the open gate of a
patio. At his approach they fell silent, but a few brief
words scattered them quickly toward their several
homes, and the man of the church tramped on, the
dust of the road sticking to his wet boots.</p>

<p>"All what brings a price and is overlooked by the
Englishmen, this padre will dig up," said Juan
Alvara. "He is getting rich from many fields."</p>

<p>"Many fields?"</p>

<p>"Many fields&mdash;the church, the little ranch he has
picked up, and the game of <i>monte</i> or <i>malilla</i>. He is
the new sort of priest they send these days from
Catalonia. No one in San Juan confesses now until
Padre Sanchez comes past. If the church wins, the
Mission will be blown down all the same, so long
while some one pay four bits a load for brick. All is
much changed. Father Sanchez is another kind&mdash;a
holy man and of God."</p>

<p>Alvara lifted his sombrero reverently.</p>

<p>"The vaqueros coming with the band of horses
from the beach soon," he observed. "We will go to
the corrals, and help you to forget the girl&mdash;no?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
"I'm not so anxious to forget, I reckon&mdash;the girl
is only a sort of dream girl. This trip was not so
much to forget a girl as to&mdash;you remember Teddy,
my half-brother?"</p>

<p>"Don Teddy? Sure&mdash;he was the life of the
valley when he came to San Juan."</p>

<p>"Yes. Well, Teddy's married; he has married the
woman who, you said, had the face of some angel."</p>

<p>"Not Angela, the señora who is Don Eduardo's
English cousin?"</p>

<p>The other nodded his head grimly.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" the old man stared at him sharply, and
then suddenly recovered himself.</p>

<p>"Teddy says his wife wants to come down here
while he is in Mexico," grunted Bryton. "What the
devil can I do with her if she comes now?"</p>

<p>"You are a relative now&mdash;is it not so?" asked
the old man, with an affectionate smile. "She is your
sister."</p>

<p>"Sister be&mdash;" If he meant blessed, he did not look
it as he tramped the veranda. "I start just the
same for the south ranch to-morrow. If she comes,
she can go to Mac's tavern, or to the Mission with
the ghosts!"</p>

<p>"That would not be good to do," said Alvara
seriously. "The wife of your brother must come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
to my house. Teresa, the widow of Miguel, is here;
her English is not anything, but it is good that your
sister have a lady with her in the house. Teresa, she
feel very bad. Don Teddy's wife was once a widow;
she will understand."</p>

</div>

<p>"Will it make many changes in the business&mdash;his
death?" asked Bryton.</p>

<p>"It will lose the ranches more quickly to the
English and the Americans," stated the older man.
"Rafael will have all the money now, and&mdash;it is good
that he gets married quick. The girl&mdash;she is Estevan's
daughter&mdash;she likes no English&mdash;so they say."</p>

<p>"Oh!&mdash;Estevan's daughter&mdash;Estevan's! I heard a
queer story of that name once&mdash;a queer story!"</p>

<p>"He left when the Americanos came to California.
Always he fought against the Americanos. He was a
strong soldier, and he die there in Mexico, and all his
money is for the girl if she marry; for the convent if
she not marry at all."</p>

<p>"It was another Estevan," said Keith. "It was a
story of an old Aztec temple that would make your
hair curl! Might have been a relation of your soldier
Estevan."</p>

<p>"There may be the same name in Mexico, but
Felipe Estevan had no brothers."</p>

<p>Keith rolled a cigarro, and did not notice that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
old man's hand trembled as he did the same, and that
his eyes were striving in vain to appear careless.</p>

<p>"My Spanish was pretty queer those days, and I
did not grasp the details of the story. You find all
sorts of half-buried towns and temples and palaces in
the country&mdash;queer places no one on earth can tell
who built. But the temple was a plain fact. Stonework
cut for all the world like that," he added,
pointing to the gray Mission ruin. "Zig-zags on
the cornices and Aztec suns just the same over the
portals. There were great old walls left, but no roof.
Trees grew all through it, and right in the open
was something like a bench covered with queer
Indian figures of fight, and sacrifices, and the only
one I ever saw down there carved out of marble."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;a bench of marble!" Alvara was listening
intently, nodding his head, and forgetting to smoke.</p>

<p>"Well, an old miner down there told me a lurid
story of the last Indian sacrifice offered up on that
altar. He found the body and helped to bury it&mdash;the
name was Estevan."</p>

<p>"It is a good name," said the old man.</p>

<p>"Fine! but wherever he had lived he was used to a
different sort of woman from the one he met at the
old temple. She was of pure Spanish and Aztec stock.
The women in those temples don't usually appear to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
count, but she came of a long line of Aztec priests.
After the Catholic Church got hold of them, they
became Catholic priests instead of Aztec ones, and
served the same God under a different name."</p>

<p>"So?" remarked Alvara.</p>

<p>"It seems Estevan drifted into the country with considerable
money&mdash;cattle-man, I think; anyway, he had a
ranch of some sort&mdash;and fell dead in love with the sister
of one of these hereditary priests, and they were married.
The old miner said a lot of queer old Indians gathered
from the Lord only knew where, and had a great bonfire
and crazy dances and ceremonies at the temple the
night she was married. They were waiting for a new
priest of their own old religion to be born some day
and every marriage in that family was of interest."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I don't know how to make clear that there
are wives in the world to whom brown girls in the
willows are&mdash;well&mdash;they are absolutely taboo to the
husbands&mdash;understand?"</p>

<p>Alvara nodded silently.</p>

<p>"This Estevan was not used to women like that.
He was crazy over the priest's sister till he got her, and
then he was like many other men&mdash;he went back to
the brown girls."</p>

<p>"And then?"
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
"Then that old Aztec tribe seemed to hear of it on
the wind&mdash;no one knows. A brown girl was caught
by the Indians one night, her long hair cut short to her
head; and the next day Estevan was found tied on that
altar with the same hair plaited into ropes. The heart
had been cut from the body and rested in a little urn or
vase carved in the stone of the wall. There were no
other mutilations or signs of cruelty&mdash;it was more like a
pagan ceremony than anything else. The girl's hair
was the only clue as to what the cause might have been."</p>

<p>"And the wife and the child&mdash;what did the man
tell you of them?"</p>

<p>"Child?" Keith stared at the old man. "I did not
mention a child; never heard there was one. The
widow of Estevan entered a convent and was never
heard of again. The old miner said the priest took
charge of the property&mdash;for the Church, he supposed!
I think of that old temple every time I see the cactus
and Aztec sun cut in this gray-green stone of your
church here; but I had forgotten the name of Estevan
until you mentioned it."</p>

<p>"It is a good name," added Alvara again. "Felipe
Estevan was wild and a fighter, but he was not a bad
man in California. He had no wife, and the girls all
wore beads he bought&mdash;but why not? He knew
we have only one life to live here!"
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
"True, señor; and the story of the tragedy made
me forget poor Teddy's comedy&mdash;one I can't laugh
at yet."</p>

<p>"Some day you ask us to a wedding, and you will
forget that marriage is a madness," said Alvara.</p>

<p>And then Doña Teresa came slowly out on the
veranda in her many folds of black. There was a
hard glitter in her little black eyes, but her lips curved
ever so slightly in a courteous greeting as Keith
Bryton bent over her hand.</p>

<p>"I hear how you telling that story, señor," she
remarked, pleasantly. "You think that it is good to
tie a gentleman on a bench, and put his heart on a
shelf&mdash;no?"</p>

<p>"Good? Why, it was the most ghastly heathenish
thing I ever heard of. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you Americanos think most of the women who
do such things," she persisted; "you think it better
than to let him live where there are the brown girls."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;señora?"</p>

<p>He saw that he had irrevocably damned himself in
her eyes. She might speak to him courteously through
a long lifetime, but one of the institutions of their
pastoral life&mdash;an institution ignored by the usual guest
in the land&mdash;had been referred to in a sarcastic manner,
and he knew that never again could he expect the good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
will of Teresa Arteaga. The allusion had been the
most distant, the most unintentional, but at the first
word the blood of the Mexican was arrayed against
the Gringo.</p>

<p>"You think it well when that wife put the knife in
the heart of the husband?" she continued. "(Yes,
Aguada, I will have a cup of orange juice, and you
may bring wine for the gentlemen.) You think your
American ladies do that same thing&mdash;no?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;the old miner never suggested that it was
the woman did it&mdash;the wife!" he protested. "It was
thought to be the work of the old hill tribe of Indians."</p>

<p>"It was not alone the Indians," stated Doña Teresa,
with sudden insight. "Men would not think to tie
him with girl's hair. No, it was the wife."</p>

<p>Alvara looked at her warningly over his glass.</p>

<p>"If there are such wives in Mexico, we hope they
stay there," he said. "Our own Indians make trouble
enough for the padre and the alcalde. The kind you
tell of are best left with their tribes in the hills."</p>

<p>For a little longer they talked of the new horses
needed for the frontier warfare, and touched upon the
chance of the Capitan's stealing them before they got
across the divide.</p>

<p>"But there is no danger even of El Capitan now,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
when the Señor Don Bryton have put himself to help
guard," remarked Teresa, eyeing him with a cat-like
glance to discover if her sarcasm was appreciated.
"We all feel very safe now in San Juan valley."</p>

<p>"With those brilliant army officers in town, you
certainly should," he remarked, easily. "The women
have always been the Capitan's best friends, and the
officers are cutting him out!"</p>

<p>"He see too much&mdash;and he talk too much," said
Teresa, as Bryton left them and walked leisurely down
the road toward the inn and post-office.</p>

<p>"He means no harm," remarked Alvara. "The
ways of the Americano are not our ways, but I like
him better than the army men. He makes no
scandals."</p>

<p>"If the army men make love to the girls, they keep
quiet about it," returned Teresa. "But this man&mdash;he
thinks himself too good for the 'brown girls' he
talks of. Men who are too good should go to stay
in the church and pray for the sinners!"</p>

<p>Alvara knew that no remark of Bryton's had been
meant to reflect in the least on social conditions in
San Juan. But what use to argue with an angry,
jealous woman hunting for a grievance?</p>

<p>The widow of Miguel had gone through the years
of jealous bitterness, the shock of Miguel's death, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
knowledge that she would inherit but a widow's share,
the nerve-wrenching strain of a Mexican funeral, the
sight of her husband's Indian children beside the
bier; but that had all been in the midst of the people
who understood&mdash;where house-servants were often
legacies to the estate from brother, or uncle, or cousin.
But this man, who told of a wife that revenged herself,
had unconsciously flung in her face a new standard; she
hated him, and hated the sort of women he knew in
his own country,&mdash;the white-faced women who had
snow in their blood and did not understand!</p>

<p>Bryton tried in vain to think what he had said to
annoy Teresa so exceedingly; could it have been
his inquiring as to the estate? Surely, she must know
that many persons were asking the same questions.
Her brother-in-law, Rafael Arteaga, was such an
uncertain quantity that wagers were plentiful as to his
management of the several ranches. If he left them
as Miguel had done, principally to the lawyers, it
might not be so bad, but Rafael's disposition to make
his own bargains made older people shake their heads.
His mother, Doña Luisa, was old and ill. He could
have time to make very bad bargains before she could
make the journey from Mexico; and even then would
she be physically able to take note of business details?
All those questions Bryton had heard talked over and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
over. Also, the matter of the wedding,&mdash;would it be
postponed because of the funeral? No one knew
whether Doña Luisa and the bride were not on the way
when the death occurred. Rafael had, it was understood,
come ahead that he might make the preparations
for their reception. A letter had also arrived
saying that all things must be put in order at the
dwelling-rooms of the Mission; it stated that the
"donas"&mdash;the bride gifts&mdash;he had selected in Mexico
might arrive any day. They had come by sea to San
Pedro, and San Juan was in quite a flutter of excitement
over its most important wedding in a generation.</p>

<p>The alcalde met Bryton, and incidentally mentioned
that it was a pity the horse deal had not been held
over for the week of the wedding; there would be barbecues
and horse races for the latter part of the week.</p>

<p>"Sorry I can't stay," observed Bryton. "I'm keeping
tab for the contractor on those cavalry horses, and
must stay with the bunch, at least until they reach Los
Angeles. Teddy has gone down into Mexico; if he
stays, I may follow."</p>

<p>"Now that one of you boys is married, you should
settle down and be a permanent citizen of some district,&mdash;what
is the matter with this place?"</p>

<p>"It's the most beautiful valley I ever saw," agreed
Bryton. "But for getting Teddy to locate sixty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
miles from town&mdash;never! And as to the lady in the
case, she will insist always on an audience more&mdash;"</p>

<p>What more it would have to be was interrupted by
the clatter of the stage down the street, and on the
seat beside the driver was a little woman in pale blue
flounces thick with dust, and a white hat with pink rosebuds
dancing and swaying with the rock of the stage.</p>

<p>"God&mdash;" began Bryton, and then checked himself.</p>

<p>The alcalde smiled.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Ordway&mdash;or Mrs. Teddy Bryton now&mdash;looks
pretty well satisfied with this as a temporary
audience," he remarked, as he sauntered across the
street to his own abode. Bryton's exclamation showed
that he was by no means pleased to see her, and the
alcalde did not care to witness a family reunion of
that sort, so he walked away smiling.</p>

<p>The lady waved her hand and flung a bright smile
toward the half-brother of her husband. He lifted his
hat, but did not move from his tracks until the horses
came to a halt, brought suddenly to their haunches by
the driver, who was making a showy entrance into the
village for the gratification of the lady.</p>

<p>"I've had a delightful trip from Los Angeles&mdash;thanks
to Don Rafael," she called, gaily. "I never&mdash;never
expect to drive so fast again. Come and help
me down!"
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
But the slender, handsome Mexican beside her
had leaped to the ground, and, sombrero in hand, was
ready to perform that service before the American
reached the stage.</p>

<p>"You are always the day after the fair, Keith," she
remarked, her eyes narrowing in a smile. "I am
a thousand times obliged to Señor Arteaga!"</p>

<p>"It is I who am honored, señora," he returned with
a sweep of the sombrero, and one brief yet steady
look into her eyes. Mrs. Bryton turned away with
a pleased little smile, and proceeded to shake the
dust from the ruffles of her sleeve.</p>

<p>Keith Bryton saw both the look and the smile, and
it gave a tinge of coldness to his greeting.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Señor Arteaga?" he remarked.
"Thank you for looking after Mrs."&mdash;the word
seemed hard to say&mdash;"Bryton. Are you adding
stage-driving to your other accomplishments?"</p>

<p>Rafael Arteaga had caused too much jealousy in his
day not to suspect he recognized it in the attitude
of the American, whom it was something of a victory
to outrival.</p>

<p>"Only when there is extra precious cargo on board,"
he said, meaningly. "American ladies are rare in San
Juan. I was the only one present to show our appreciation
of such a visit."
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
"But I am not an American&mdash;never in this world!"
she insisted. "It was only the accident of marriage
took me to your Mexican America. I was born
in London, and am a subject of the Queen! Don't
ever fancy me an American!"</p>

<p>"Few people will make that mistake," said Bryton,
dryly. "I suppose you know that your cousin and
his wife are not here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I discovered that through Señor Arteaga
when I was part way down. But he tells me the army
men are here, and that there are always dances, horse
races, and a general festival while they stay. I thought
it might be worth while. Señor Arteaga will look
after me if you are too busy."</p>

<p>"With many thanks for the honor, señora."</p>

<p>"The barbecues are over," said Bryton; "they
were rather subdued this time, because of the funeral
of Don Rafael's brother. I leave with the army men
to-morrow for a trip farther north, and you had
best return to Los Angeles, or go to your cousin in
San Diego."</p>

<p>She pretended to busy herself concerning a bandbox
on which the cord had broken, but her little white
teeth bit into her lip. Rafael had entered the post-office
with the driver of the stage.</p>

<p>"I am not interested in San Diego," she observed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
"There must be somewhere in this row of adobes a
place where a lady could stay."</p>

<p>"There is the tavern kept by Mac. You may be
able to retain a room there alone, if no other women
stop over."</p>

<p>"Share a room with strangers? But Don Rafael
offered&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don Rafael has only several adobes here, where
the vaqueros eat and sleep&mdash;neither he nor his brother
has lived here as a regular thing; when they do,
they share the house of the major-domo, who has
an Indian wife. The only privacy Don Rafael could
assure you of would be to give you the key of the
Mission."</p>

<p>"That graveyard! I must say you are not very
brotherly, amigo&mdash;I learned some more words of
Spanish on the way down! Well, if I must go to
the awful tavern, I must! Do you suppose that
villanous-looking black-and-tan in the serape will
carry my boxes into the hotel? You've not said
one civil word, Keith! Are Teddy and I to do
the best we can without your blessing?" she asked,
mockingly.</p>

<p>He looked at her slowly from head to foot, and
back to her innocent wide-open blue eyes.</p>

<p>"I congratulate you," he said, briefly. "I will see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
that your belongings are taken to your room. The
gentleman in the serape chances to be a Mexican
Don, not accustomed to carting bandboxes."</p>

<p>"You are not very cordial in your congratulations,"
she observed, as if determined to break down his cold
unconcern,&mdash;to make him <i>say</i> something.</p>

<p>"No, I'm not," he agreed, tersely. "If Teddy
had given me any idea of it, you know he would not
have been a married man now."</p>

<p>"Oh, I knew you would be jealous, no matter whom
he married," she replied; "I told him so!"</p>

<p>"So I supposed. But if you want to secure a room
alone, you'd better not delay. Apartments are rather
at a premium in San Juan."</p>

<p>He walked with her past the admiring group of
prominent citizens toward the patio of the inn.
Several of the men swept sombreros to the earth
as she passed. The cousin of Don Eduardo was a
lady they must show special deference to, even if
she had been ugly, which she certainly was not.</p>

<p>Most of them envied the tall, rather good-looking
fellow swinging along by her side, but he did not seem
as happy in the privilege as others would have been.
Alvara, seeing himself forgotten for Don Eduardo's
pretty blonde cousin, smiled a little, and continued his
walk alone to the corral.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
"She make him forget,&mdash;but she is not the woman,"
he said, shrewdly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bryton surveyed the coarse furnishings of the
adobe with disgust as she was led to the one room
where she could secure sleeping accommodation. It
contained three beds with as many different-colored
spreads, queer little pillows, and drawn-work on one
towel hanging on a nail. The floor had once been tiled
with square Mission bricks; but many were broken,
some were gone, and the empty spaces were so many
traps for unwary feet. Names of former occupants
were scratched in the whitewashed wall. There was no
window, and but one door opening on the patio and
to be fastened from within by a wooden bar.</p>

<p>"But this&mdash;there must be something better than
this!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"It is the one home where you could make yourself
understood. The proprietor chances to speak
English. If you come without notifying your&mdash;relatives,
you must take what you find, or go on to
San Diego. Your cousin is there&mdash;also his wife."</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders, and dropped wearily
to a wooden bench.</p>

<p>"I can't ride another mile&mdash;I'm dead tired. But
you don't ask why I came!"</p>

<p>"That is your husband's affair, not mine," he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
returned. "If there is nothing else I can do for you,
I will go and look after my own affairs. I start south
in the morning."</p>

<p>"Because I came?" she demanded, with a slight
smile. At sight of it his face flushed, and then the
color receded while he regarded her steadily.</p>

<p>"Don't make any mistake about that," he suggested.
"I did leave town out of impatience with
another friend of mine, who was wasting his time
with you. Of course he would not listen to me,
and he has evidently told you. I liked him, and
did not want to see him made a fool of."</p>

<p>"Oh, you are a silly!" she replied, unfastening
her hat-string and glancing at him strangely. "It
never was that man for one little minute; you, of all
the men, ought to know."</p>

<p>"I, of all the men, have been the one who did not
guess that it was Teddy," he retorted. "But since
it is, there is one thing to remember,&mdash;Teddy is the
best fellow in the world, and the easiest mark, and
you are not to forget it!"</p>

<p>"I did not promise to honor and obey you!" she
retorted, petulantly.</p>

<p>"But if you don't in this case&mdash;" he halted abruptly
and walked away. Her high, sweet voice called after
him, but he did not turn his head. He evidently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
realized that he had come very near threatening her;
and, after all, if Teddy chose to make a fool of himself
for a pretty doll&mdash;</p>

<p>For she was undeniably pretty, and she had created
quite a flurry a year before when she reached San
Pedro by steamer from Mexico, a girlish widow with
one child, and waited there until the English cousin
of her husband, Eduardo Downing, had been notified
and came up in state from his ranches, with his Mexican
wife, to receive her.</p>

<p>One child more or less never made any difference
on the ranch of Eduardo, and his wife rather liked the
little white doll that was alive, for her own brown-skinned
grandchildren to play with. It was better
than an Indian baby&mdash;more of a novelty, so that the
family affairs of the young widow were easily adjusted.
She accepted invitations to visit friends of her cousin
on ranches and in town. For a year she had earned
the reputation of being a rather gay flirt, and she could
have married several times. Keith Bryton's friends
had more than hinted that she was waiting for him,
and when the word went abroad that it was his half-brother,
eyes were opened wide in Los Angeles.
There were lifted brows, and smiles. Keith knew
how the marriage would be commented upon, and he
was filled with rage that she should assume at once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
her care-free attitude, and fraternize with Rafael
Arteaga, as she evidently had done on the ride down.
And Teddy trusted her absolutely&mdash;good old Teddy,
who had been infatuated from the first sight of her, and
had loved without hope until lately, very lately indeed!</p>

<p>They had been married on the eve of his trip to
Mexico. His letter, written that night, and given her
to mail, had been held back by the bride until she was
ready to follow it on the next stage. What mad idea
had she in thus coming to the last village likely to
be attractive to her? Was it to enjoy her victory?&mdash;to
show him that his years of devotion to Teddy
went for nothing when she chose to turn the light
of her countenance his way?</p>

<p>Something like that it must have been,&mdash;the freakish
defiance of a spoiled child. Not innocent, despite the
big baby-blue eyes, but too ignorant of social conditions
in this Mexican town for him to leave her to the guardianship
of Rafael Arteaga when he should ride away
to-morrow. The only American men in the place were
unmarried. For Teddy's sake he must see that she
went too. For Teddy's sake&mdash;that was the devil of it!</p>

<p>Rafael was lounging in the door of the post-office
smoking, when Bryton emerged from the patio.
There was a smile in his eyes as he noted the annoyed
face of the American.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
"I was waiting for you, amigo," he said, walking
beside him. "I have no wish to object to the hotel
of our friend Mac; but I believe it may be possible
to secure a better place for señora, your sister.
The widow of my brother is still here, Mac has just
told me. I can turn over to them a house of plenty
of room to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Many thanks to you, Don Rafael; but the lady
will probably remain only until the next stage passes.
It will not be necessary to inconvenience any of your
people."</p>

<p>He nodded good-naturedly and left Rafael at the
gate of Alvara. Teresa was yet on the veranda, interested
in the one event of the day, the arrival of
the stage, and the lady who was its most noticeable
passenger. Alvara did not think it could have been
Don Eduardo's cousin, for if so, surely Señor Bryton
would have brought her at once to the Alvara home.
Teresa, on the other hand, insisted that it was the
English cousin; she had seen her once, and was sure
that no other white woman would look so much like
a white doll.</p>

<p>They at once appealed to Rafael to settle the
question. Teresa pushed a chair toward him and
suggested a glass of wine.</p>

<p>"Thou art tired, of course, and choked with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
dust; a desert wind blew to-day! And who was your
pretty señorita? Don Juan Alvara and I could not
agree; he said it could not be the cousin of Don
Eduardo, or she would certainly have accepted the
very kind invitation he gave her to live here while
waiting for her relations."</p>

<p>"Invitation?" Rafael looked quickly from one to
the other. "I am very sure Señora Bryton failed to receive
your invitation. She confessed herself in despair
if her cousin should not be here on her arrival."</p>

<p>"But Señor? Bryton was told to bring her here."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;h!" He was silent a moment and then he
smiled reassuringly. "I see how it is! He thinks
she will remain over only one day and does not like
to put you to trouble; but the poor lady down there
alone is no doubt very uncomfortable&mdash;perhaps unhappy.
If your daughters could call and see her&mdash;I
would accompany them. In fact, for the cousin of Don
Eduardo I will do anything I may be allowed to do."</p>

<p>"Sure," agreed Alvara; "it is the right thing for
a lady to ask her;&mdash;if only Dolores and Madalena
have not ridden to the beach&mdash;"</p>

<p>He went into the house to see, and Teresa looked
at Rafael and shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Thou hast told a part, but not all, my Rafael,"
she said, quietly. "Is the so good Señor Bryton not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
so good at last? Does he want his brother's wife to
see only himself?"</p>

<p>"You don't like him?" he said, quickly.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;if not?"</p>

<p>"Then we could play him a fine trick&mdash;fine! He
is jealous, that is all. She rode down with me, and of
course, when I learned who she was, we talked&mdash;you
saw! Well, our Americano likes to be the only man.
He means to send her away to-morrow,&mdash;he is so
angry because she marry his brother! Of course she
goes, unless we keep her. It would be a good trick
to play if we could walk down there, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We will go," decided Teresa, promptly; "at
once we will go before he comes back from the corral.
His brother's wife&mdash;eh? I ask myself if those people&mdash;the
Americanos&mdash;are so much better than our
own men, Rafael. I want no scandal and will help
you with none; but if you take from him the woman
he wants, I will make you a present&mdash;a fine one."</p>

<p>"It is a bargain!" he agreed. "I promise to earn
the gift. He is a good enough fellow, but much too
conceited; we will cure him!"</p>

<p>As Alvara came out on the veranda to tell them
Dolores and Madalena were away, and to ask Teresa
to call on the stranger in their stead, Teresa and
Rafael were on the street.
</p>

<p>$1
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
"It is a good thing to do," he thought, contentedly
rolling a cigarro and looking after them. "It is a
kindness to Don Eduardo's cousin, and it is good for
Teresa. For the first time since the death of Miguel
she is smiling. Yes, it is a good thing."</p>

<p>When Bryton left the corrals, the evening had
come; the afterglow was flooding the hills with pale
rose, and Indian boys were driving home cows
through the village street. The more time he had to
consider the matter, the more impatient he grew at
the reckless disregard of his new sister-in-law for the
conventionalities.</p>

<p>Since she had married Teddy, she might at least
have remained decently and quietly where he had left
her. Or she might have continued her journey and
joined her cousin at San Diego; but to do so mad a
thing as to stop off here&mdash;he determined she should
go either north or south to-morrow, if he had to carry
her to the stage. He would tell her so at once.</p>

<p>He had arrived at that determination as he crossed
the plaza and heard her laugh through the door of
Alvara's house. The door was open; she was trying
to teach Alvara English, at which his daughters
laughed very much. It was the sharp eyes of Teresa
that caught sight of Bryton first, as he involuntarily
halted in the road.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
"Yes, Señor Bryton, it is all true; we have robbed
the Señor Mac's hotel of your sister!" she called to
him with a new air of elation,&mdash;of victory.</p>

<p>Alvara appeared and invited him to supper, which
he declined for a previous engagement with Don
Antonio. His sister-in-law came out and listened to
his excuses, and smiled quietly at him with the baby-blue
eyes, in which he read a certain defiance.</p>

<p>"I would have smothered in that awful cell you
took me to!" she pouted. "These people are charming
to me; they are friends of Cousin Edward's. It
was Don Rafael took them to me. He looks like a
hero in a picture-book! How does it come I never
met him before?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps because during your last visit down here
he was in Mexico, making love to the girl he is to
marry very soon."</p>

<p>"Oh! is <i>that</i> why you are guarding him so carefully?"
she said, laughingly. "Well, since I am
married, I am willing to stay and dance at his wedding;
but, Keith, if I had seen him first&mdash;"</p>

<p>She broke off, laughing at the quick anger in his eyes.</p>

<p>And Teresa, listening, understood the game of
Rafael and the mocking laughter, and the anger of
Bryton, and was as happy as she was likely to be,
with Miguel under the ground.</p>

<p>Many things had happened, and
it had been a bad day. "A
day cursed of God!" said Pedro
Gallardo, the driver; and against
such ill fortune the carriage of
Señora Luisa Arteaga made such
progress as might be, from San
Luis Rey to San Juan.</p>

<p>Clouds had drifted along the mountains each night
for a week, and never the ranges a bit the better for
it, until the cavalcade of Doña Luisa had started
north from San Diego; and then&mdash;well, it was not
what you would call a rain, it was a torrent came
down. The skies had opened, and a deluge followed.</p>

<p>Then, after leaving San Luis Rey, a carriage-pole
must break in an attempt at a runaway, and two
horses were lost over that, to say nothing of the off
leader, whose "sire had been the devil, and whose
dam had been a witch thrice accursed in the foaling!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Their joint offspring had demonstrated his infernal
lineage by breaking his own leg as well as the carriage-pole,
and another untamed beast had to be roped on
the range&mdash;hog-tied, and blindfolded to get the harness
on him; and because of him Pedro's throat was
fairly blistered with curses.</p>

<p>As the wheels sank into the sands or plunged from
one ravine into another, Doña Luisa prayed and
trusted to the saints that she might see her own valley
again, and her companion, Doña Jacoba, protested, and
forgetting to pray, waxed argumentative.</p>

<p>"Raquel was right, Luisa," she repeated for the
twentieth time between her groans; "we had been
wise to wait at San Diego for Rafael. She has an old
head on her shoulders&mdash;you will have a wise daughter
when the day comes."</p>

<p>"Wise! Yes&mdash;yes!" moaned Doña Luisa, shaking
her head. "I thank the Virgin for that, every day,
for Rafael is young, Jacoba; a baby of a wife would
be his ruin. Yet&mdash;a baby might love him!"</p>

<p>"Our boys get love enough!" grunted Jacoba,
thinking of her own sons, and her own troubles.
"They need wives with sense; and our girls all go
wild these days about the Americanos, so&mdash;"</p>

</a>
<p>Raquel Estevan</p>
</div>

<p>"The girls, too!" and Doña Luisa's tones were
strident with censure. "It is bad enough when men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
must buy and sell with the Americanos in the markets;
but the girls,&mdash;the women of California,&mdash;it is in
their hands to shut the door when the Americano
knocks&mdash;is it not so?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, of course&mdash;yes&mdash;it is as you say,"
agreed Jacoba, weakly, as she thought of the many
girls of their relationship, who had opened doors very
wide indeed for the Americanos, and of not a few who
were to open also the door of the Church. But who
could tell Doña Luisa that?</p>

<p>"Rafael is all I have left, now that Miguel is killed,"
continued the mother. "My only grandchildren are
half-breeds, and only Rafael is left. Ai! it is hard to
grow old,&mdash;to let go all lines. But you know what
makes me happy, Jacoba? No? It is this one big
thing. Raquel will be what I was. She may suffer,
but she will stand square on her feet; and she will fight
as her father fought&mdash;and it will be for California."</p>

<p>"You think so?" asked Jacoba, doubtfully. "It
may be so, but&mdash;do you expect strong fights from
a girl who was half a nun? I say she knows too little
of the world to fight it."</p>

<p>"You take from me my one hope when you say
that!" and the older woman put out her hand
appealingly. "Our men are wild&mdash;always! It is the
women's work to save them. The death of Miguel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
is making me think much and quick. Rafael must
be marry. There must be no more Indio women and
children."</p>

<p>Jacoba glanced doubtfully at her friend. These
five years, while Rafael had been learning California
ranch life, Jacoba had lived near enough to hear much
that she never could repeat to the old mother, whose
life was so nearly spent, whose weakness and prejudices
could never cope with the new life in the
changed land&mdash;and of what use to torture her with
the truth? She wished with all her heart the exile
had elected to stop over at San Diego or San Luis
Rey, until some little glimmer of present conditions
should enlighten her.</p>

<p>"It is well the <i>donas</i> came by water," she remarked,
eager to find some straw of comfort in the situation.
"Even extra baggage would be a care, with these roads
and troubles, to say nothing of the temptation to El
Capitan! Thanks to God, he never yet has had
record of troubling women on the road."</p>

<p>"He was a fine boy," said Doña Luisa, musingly.
"It is not his fault that he is an outlaw to these States.
It means only that he is patriot to California. He
was a fine boy."</p>

<p>"Ask thy son how fine he thinks El Capitan!"
remarked Jacoba. "Rafael has paid him a heavy tax
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
in his best stock. They have long ago forgotten they
are cousins."</p>

<p>"Raquel will make him remember," said the older
woman, with certainty. "Did he not fight as he was
able beside her father? Ai! he fought for California
when only a boy. Do Californians forget?"</p>

<p>"He does not let them do so," remarked Jacoba
dryly. "Much has changed, Luisa."</p>

<p>"I see no change, only the Indios more poor.
The hills are green, as always after the rains. All
these ranges are the same like we rode over them forty
years ago. The hills and the sea never change, only
the people. It is good to hear there is one of the
young left who thinks in the old way."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;holy Maria!&mdash;we were never robbers,
Luisa!"</p>

<p>"Well, we did not need to be," returned her
friend. "But I tell you truly, Jacoba, I could find
it in my heart to forgive a son who fought the Americanos
as he does, even if they made him outlaw. He
could not be outlaw to the Church, nor to me."</p>

<p>Jacoba said no more. Of what use was it to tell
her that a few such women would be firebrands in the
land if they had youth, and that the American soldiers,
instead of coming peacefully to buy stock and pay
good prices, would come from Los Angeles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
shooting,&mdash;would come with torches to burn each town where
rebels hid. It was no longer little internal wars, such
as they used to have in the days they both remembered,
when the men who smoked or played together one
month would fight under different leaders the next.</p>

<p>There were no faction fights now. It was one
great ugly pale nation to the east, trailing slowly over
the ranges and planting itself like the live-oak in the
cañons. The Mexicans might hate, might curse; but
the curses made no difference against the heretics.
They had no churches, and they laughed at the beautiful
wooden saints in the old chapel. Had not some
of them snuffed out candles on the graves with their
accursed rifles, last All Souls' Day? Yet the sky
had not fallen, and no earthquake had come! What
would even prayers or holy Church do against a people
so ignored by God?</p>

<p>But Jacoba knew there was no use to fight. She
remembered what that meant in the other days. In
an old adobe of San Juan's one street she had helped
as a girl to nurse the wounded of San Pascual. It
was years ago, but she had not forgotten the cruel
wounds, or the young Americano who died in her
arms there. She had never mentioned to any
the reason of her hatred for war; for even with
revenge in reach, on whom would she seek it?&mdash;on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
her brother who had killed a stranger forcing their
gates?</p>

<p>"You do not forget how the blessed Junípero Serra
himself spoke from the altar of San Juan in the old
days, Luisa; our grandfather telling us that many
times,&mdash;how, when the Spanish guard was hard with
the Indios, he stood on the altar and say that a new
people will come and put the foot on the neck of the
Mexican like the Mexican tramp on the Indios.
He say it, and cry&mdash;cry for the reason that the good
God no can make their hearts more soft to the Indios.
I think of that when I see the Americanos come. They
not put the foot on the neck&mdash;but they are here!"</p>

<p>"Father Junípero was old then&mdash;very old&mdash;like
a child, and would make of the Indios babies to be
petted," returned Doña Luisa, leniently. "He was a
saint&mdash;not a man; only the saints could have the
patience with those Indios&mdash;I remember! One of
the old scares of the padre's was that the water would
fail us; yet San Juan still has its river!"</p>

<p>Jacoba nodded. They were likely to find the river
a difficulty after the rainfall. The ford was not a
good one in high water; but the thought of getting
across the ford was a trifle compared to the difficulty
of impressing Doña Luisa with any idea of the
change she would find in the land she had known.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
In sheer despair she returned once more to a safer
subject, Raquel Estevan,&mdash;Raquel the wise, who was
to marry with Rafael and forever build a wall about
him from American influence; Raquel, who might not
love, because of that dark shadow of the cloister, but
who would be all the more wise for that! Still, who
could tell?</p>

<p>"When one is young like that, one never can be
sure until the right man comes," said Jacoba; "and
she is handsome, your Raquel. But is it true what
they say, that there was the blood of the old Mexican
Indios in her mother?"</p>

<p>Doña Luisa did not commit herself; yet she realized
that Raquel Estevan might have a few battles to fight
along the line of race, as well as against the Americanos;
for of course Rafael was a favorite; of course
there would be burning hearts and jealousy at first.</p>

<p>From Las Flores, where the Indian
village still held together in
a shiftless sort of way, Raquel
Estevan and her friend Ana
Mendez galloped north mile
on mile over the mesa above
the sea.</p>

<p>"Art never tired, Raquel?" demanded the older
and darker of the two as they halted to let their animals
drink where a rivulet ran full from the foothills.
"Since we left the ranch house thou hast never
lessened the gallop."</p>

<p>"Tired? I should shame to acknowledge that,
when Doña Luisa never rests on the way. She
endures it all, while only the young ones complain."</p>

<p>"Endures! What would she not endure for her
beloved Rafael&mdash;now your beloved Rafael?"</p>

<p>Ana was not malicious, but there was a touch of
mockery in her tone and questioning glance.</p>

<p>"Why should he not be beloved?" asked the other,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
smoothing carefully the mane of her horse and bending
low to conceal the slight flush of cheek. "Is he
not handsome and good?"</p>

<p>"It is not easy to be good when a man is so handsome,"
laughed Ana; "still, I will take your word
for it! But, Raquel, you always get clear of the
question; not once have you said that you find him
beloved. Are you going to be coquette to the
wedding-day?"</p>

<p>"You talk to amuse yourself," and the violet dark
eyes were lifted an instant. "You learn to coquette
when you marry, and cannot forget; but the nuns
never teach us that."</p>

<p>"What need?" and Ana showed her white teeth in
a laugh. "They did not teach us we must breathe
to live; yet some way we learned it! But confess!
You outride all the party to reach San Juan, and
Rafael; yet how are we sure what urges you?"</p>

<p>"My promise."</p>

<p>"But why the promise, if the man is not beloved?
You have had no harsh guardian, as I had; you were
all free."</p>

<p>"Free? Oh yes, I had always the choice between
some husband and the veil of a nun. And then&mdash;then
Doña Luisa came with her love and her son,
and her great plans of good work I could do out in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the world. And so&mdash;and so we are riding to meet
him, and I outride you!"</p>

<p>"I never hasten to trouble," remarked Ana Mendez;
"and if we should meet him on the way, you
would send me at once to the carriage. I should put
in hours listening to the virtues of Rafael Arteaga and
peril my soul pretending to agree with his mother."</p>

<p>"Why should you do that?"</p>

<p>"Raquel, do you really see how little the ideas of
Don Rafael and his mother agree? I know little
enough&mdash;thanks to California, which keeps its girls
from education; but I do see that every thought of
Rafael Arteaga is for the new ways, the ways of the
Americano."</p>

<p>The younger girl drew up her horse with a cruel
jerk, and faced her friend.</p>

<p>"Anita, beloved," she said, sadly, "you have said
the thing I felt, but did not know. Why not let some
less dear one tell me?"</p>

<p>"Holy Maria! Who else would? You are going
among strangers, but you are no more a stranger to
the California of to-day than is Doña Luisa. I hope
all the time some one tell you at San Diego, or at San
Luis Rey, but no one does; and Rafael does not meet
us; and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The letter did not reach him, or else he has gone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
by boat," said the other, steadily. "Anita, why do
you sometimes seem not quite friendly to Rafael?
Your words&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never think it!" cried Ana. "We are friends
enough, but&mdash;I know him better than his mother&mdash;that
is all! He has turned the heads of many girls,
but I do not think he has turned yours, Raquelita!"</p>

<p>The other girl made no reply.</p>

<p>"I do not think so," continued her friend, "because
you have never once lost sight of duty,&mdash;the
duty Doña Luisa and the padre have taught you to
see. You are good, Raquel,&mdash;when you are not in a
temper; but about Rafael you do not think your own
thoughts. You dream of the life of your father and
Doña Luisa when all this land was theirs. But the
dream is gone, and to-day we wake up."</p>

<p>"I see&mdash;the old world was too slow. You wake
up to be all Americano&mdash;no?"</p>

<p>"Raquel, do you hate them as much as Doña
Luisa?"</p>

<p>The girl from Mexico turned her face toward the
sea, and did not answer at once. Then she said:</p>

<p>"Only once in my life have I spoken with an
Americano, and I did not hate him."</p>

<p>"A young man?"</p>

<p>"He&mdash;he was not old," she confessed.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
"On my soul, I believe you have had a lover!"
cried Ana. "Oho! you can play Rafael at his own
game, after all! Santa Maria! I thought you were
too pretty to be the saint they think you. Tell me!"</p>

<p>"There is not anything to tell," said the younger
girl, quietly, though the color crept to her cheek; and
then after a little she added, "He died. I never saw
him but once; the padre said I was wrong to&mdash;to&mdash;oh,
they said things to me about heretics! I never
knew any other, and I promised not to. But if he
had lived I should not have promised; that is all."</p>

<p>"All! Rafael would think it enough! On my
soul, I am glad you are so human&mdash;though I have no
love myself for heretics!"</p>

<p>"Human!" mused Raquel. "Is it human to remember,
when one should forget and cannot?"</p>

<p>She did not say it aloud, and refused to discuss the
matter further.</p>

<p>"He is dead," she said; "Rafael cannot be jealous
of a man I saw but once; it was only the dream of a
girl&mdash;like a picture in a book&mdash;and the page is closed.
I shall marry Rafael, and work in the world instead
of in the convent. It is for Mother Church and&mdash;it
is right!"</p>

<p>At San Onofre the surf was breaking against the
cliffs. It was high tide, and the beach road was deep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
enough for a horse to swim. Raquel had ridden far
ahead, and now stood on the brink of a torrent cutting
its way down from the hills to the sea.</p>

<p>The girl glanced back at the swaying chariot-like
carriage on a far hill, and wondered what would be
expected of their broncos in this crisis.</p>

<p>The animal she herself rode danced and fretted with
fright at the roar of the surf and the dash of the hill
stream, but she sat the saddle with ease, answering
to every curve or side leap as lightly as a gull that
floated on the incoming wave.</p>

<p>Her face held something of the power suggested by
her strong right hand. The eyes were so soft, yet
steady, and of darkest violet. The black lashes touching
her cheeks gave them tender shadows, and the
hair, in two thick braids reaching to her waist, framed
a face of youthful curves and charm. But what was
it made every man, and many women, turn to look
again at the face of Raquel Estevan?</p>

<p>Many girls were as beautiful, but something beyond
the beauty of feature or color was in her strange half-Egyptian
face,&mdash;a certain barbaric note held in check
by the steady eyes and the mouth firm yet tender. It
was a mouth made for love; yet&mdash;was it the shadow
of the dark veil she had so nearly worn? Was it a
hint of regret for the cloistered life left behind? Or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
was it the shadow of some future&mdash;a prophecy of
the years to come?</p>

<p>Ana paused at the edge of the stream, in terror at
the volume of water barring their way on every side.</p>

<p>"Ai! ai! And Aunt Jacoba but a moment ago
declaring that she will have her supper in the refectory
of the San Juan Mission. Neither Mission nor supper
can we see this night&mdash;and no Rafael!"</p>

<p>She turned dismayed though roguish eyes on Raquel.</p>

<p>"He did not expect us when the rains came," said
Raquel with quiet certainty. "If he received Doña
Luisa's letter, he has gone by sea to San Diego. Did
she not say so, Anita?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he can do much, your handsome Rafael,"
agreed Ana, "but he cannot yet stop the tide, or dam
La Christienita! Such a dry bed in Summer! and
now it is a river."</p>

<p>"But not deep?" hazarded Raquel. "Not so deep
as the carriage bed."</p>

<p>"Deep? There is one ford that is safe if one
knows it; but, Holy Maria! on each side are pits of
a depth to drown us all!"</p>

<p>"Oh, if there is a good ford to be found&mdash;" The
rest of Raquel's sentence was drowned in Ana's shrieks
of protest, as her horse was spurred into the torrent
in search of the roadway safe for a carriage.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Ana was right; there were pits, and there were great
round bowlders on the edges of them. The horse
stumbled on one, recovered, and stumbled again where
the current swung into a whirlpool; and then, as
the water roaring in her ears almost drowned Ana's
screams, a sharp authoritative voice sounded from the
bank&mdash;</p>

<p>"Loose the stirrup!"</p>

<p>Raquel did so mechanically, just as a rope circled
about her shoulders, pinning her arms to her sides,
and with a quick, cruel jerk she was wrenched from
the saddle; and as her horse, relieved of her weight,
swam straight for the opposite shore, she felt herself
caught by a strong arm and lifted across another saddle.
The man with the reata had caught her first,
lest she be dragged downward into the whirlpool, but
it was another man who dashed through the whirl of
waters and bore her to the shore, where half a dozen
men waited. They were evidently vaqueros; one of
them had thrown the reata, and hastened now to loosen
it, to lift her from her rescuer and stand her on her
feet. She swayed a trifle, and reaching blindly for
support, she caught the arm of a man beside her,
the one who had lifted her from the water. Then for
the first time she noticed that he wore the garb of a
priest, evidently a secular priest, for he wore a beard,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and even then it struck her as strange that he looked
so bronzed and rugged. His grasp was that of a rider
of the range, rather than a priest of the Church.</p>

<p>"Father, the Virgin have you in her keeping!
You saved my life then. I shall always&mdash;always&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then she could no longer distinguish priest from
vaquero; the earth seemed to meet the sky, and between
them she was extinguished.</p>

<p>When she awoke she no longer could hear the
screams of Ana, and the red rays of the lowering
sun touched the face of the priest as he bent over her.
It had more of youth than she had at first perceived.</p>

<p>"Lie you still," he said, as one used to command.
"The water was rough with you, and the reata rougher.
Swallow some of this wine; it came from your own
carriage, and is better than ours."</p>

<p>"From the carriage?" The carriage was on the
opposite side of the stream, but her horse had followed
her and was tied near, shaking himself like a
great dog.</p>

<p>"Yes. I sent one of the boys&mdash;the vaqueros&mdash;across.
Your friends know you are safe, but the carriage
cannot come over&mdash;not yet; you have had good
fortune to get out."</p>

<p>"The good fortune was to find you here, father," she
said, and catching his hand she kissed it reverently.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
"It is a good omen and shows me a blessing is on
my journey to my father's land. You may have
known him by name. I am Raquel Estevan, and
it was my father Felipe who once owned this land
from mountain to sea."</p>

<p>"Felipe Estevan&mdash;you! But that cannot be. He
is dead, and his one child is in religion&mdash;I was told
so&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>The color came back to her face, and she raised
herself on her elbow.</p>

<p>"It is true&mdash;I was for the Church&mdash;but I will tell
you all&mdash;some time!"</p>

<p>"Go on," said the priest, authoritatively, "tell me
now!"</p>

<p>"I was told it was better to work for God out in
the world," she said, softly, "and so I am coming
with my Aunt Luisa, father's cousin, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And&mdash;" he looked at her strangely. "Then it
is you&mdash;you they bring to marry with Rafael Arteaga.
Holy Mary! And it is Felipe's daughter&mdash;Felipe
Estevan&mdash;who sold for a song rather than live under
the Americanos; and it is for his daughter I wait here
by San Onofre&mdash;for his daughter!"</p>

<p>Raquel stared at his evident agitation, not understanding.
The sentences of the padre sank to muttering
beneath the black beard, as he turned and strode
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
away. The vaqueros, standing together holding their
horses as if eager to be gone, exchanged wondering
glances and eyed the girl curiously. Directly he came
striding back and halted beside her.</p>

<p>"Yet you marry with Rafael Arteaga," he said, accusingly.
"You are Felipe's daughter, yet you are
much Americano&mdash;eh? You are of the States, is it
not so? Between you two, old California will no
longer have foot-room from San Jacinto to the water
out there. God!" and he ground his heel into the
turf. "Yet are you Felipe's daughter, and we must
let you go!"</p>

<p>"No!" she cried as vehemently as he. "I go
nowhere from the rules of my father in this land.
The things he loved I love; the things he fought for
I will guard! It is for that, father, I marry with
Rafael. He is&mdash;he is not so much for old California,
I know&mdash;I hear! His mother is afraid; she
grieves over that much! But the two of us&mdash;the
two of us, with your prayers to help, and we keep
him always for our father's country&mdash;always till
he die&mdash;with your help!"</p>

<p>"With my&mdash;help?"</p>

<p>"Your prayers, father! You will see I am Felipe
Estevan's daughter, even while I am born in Mexico.
I will do what a son would do for our land and our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Church. You will see&mdash;you will see! It is a blessing
from God that you meet me here like this at the
edge of the land. Always I have thought these
thoughts in my heart, but only to you&mdash;a priest&mdash;could
I say them in words, and it is well you meet me
here like this. Your words are the words I needed
to make me see what I want to do. It is like a baptism
that I went under that water a girl, and your
hand lift me out a woman! The Virgin sent me here
this day that I meet you. You have opened the gate
of the land for Felipe Estevan's daughter."</p>

<p>He leaned against the trunk of a young live-oak
and stared at her with a derisive smile in the smoke-black
eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, the Virgin sent me," he said at last, "and
she came near sending me too late. The trail is bad
along La Christienita for the night-time, and the
night is close. The man will take you back to your
friends."</p>

<p>"But you, father? You come to the carriage and
see the mother of Rafael&mdash;no? They wait for us.
Doña Luisa is so very old; she will be anxious till she
speak with me&mdash;and with you."</p>

<p>She arose and held out her hand. He regarded
her strangely, and shook his head.</p>

<p>"The men have other work than to camp with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
pleasure party. I stay on this side and have far to
travel before sunrise. This once I talk with you&mdash;maybe
nevermore, and to San Juan you take one
message for Rafael Arteaga."</p>

<p>"A message? Yes?"</p>

<p>"Tell him Felipe Estevan's daughter has saved to
him this once a treasure; but no woman can guard
him always, for&mdash;El Capitan is never too far to come
quickly!"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;Capitan?" she said with sudden comprehension.
"I was told at San Luis Rey how much he is
the enemy of Rafael. But it must not be, father.
Cannot we help that? I have heard of Capitan from
an old soldier of the wars, who told me all I know
of my father: he was a brave boy and&mdash;he fought
beside my father. I remembered that when I passed
his mother's grave at San Luis Rey&mdash;it will never
be bare and forgotten again&mdash;never! I planted it
thick with the passion-vine. Doña Luisa tells me
she was a great woman. She prays that some day
the two cousins may be friends."</p>

<p>"Doña Luisa prays for what only the good God
could make happen," said the priest, grimly. "But of
course all things are possible to the good God, even
in the land which God forgot. Fidele is waiting."</p>

<p>He made a movement toward the Mexican holding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
her horse, and without further words mounted another
animal himself, and galloped away along the fringe
of trees skirting the cañon. Several of the others followed.
Only three remained to watch Fidele pilot his
charge across the ford, where the ford was safe though
deep; and once her animal's feet touched the opposite
bank, her attendant, with a sweep of sombrero, but no
words, wheeled his own horse and fell in line after his
comrades, who were disappearing one by one toward
the mountains.</p>

<p>Raquel Estevan sat her horse at the edge of the
stream and stared after them, giving little heed to the
shrill calls and exclamations of the women. Even
after they had stripped her of the soaked riding-dress
and wrapped her in serapes for the night, she maintained
a thoughtful silence, and all Ana's hints of
romances went for nought, so far as gaining replies
or special notice.</p>

<p>What treasure had Felipe Estevan's daughter saved
for Rafael Arteaga? And why&mdash;why&mdash;that strange
intensity of the priest? These questions were turned
again and again in her mind as she lay there in
the light of the camp-fire watching the stars move
across the high blue. The other three women were
sleeping as best they could in the carriage, smothered
in serapes. Jacoba lamented every waking moment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
because of much-feared rheumatism,&mdash;she was so certain
it would mean a camp at the hot springs for
a month, just at the time of the wedding!</p>

<p>Doña Luisa made no complaint. When told the
carriage could not by any means cross safely, she
braced herself for the ordeal of the night, and Raquel,
glancing toward her, could see her face gray-white
in the gathering dusk. All the night that gray profile
met her eyes, for she slept not at all.</p>

<p>The driver had stretched himself where his horses
were tethered, but the two Indian boys who rode with
the carriage kept a fire of aliso boughs burning.
They would nod at times with sleepiness, but the
whispered command of the girl ever wakened them
quickly, and the dying fire would blaze again. There
was no conversation, only brief commands and prompt
obedience; and thus the girl passed the first night in
the land of her father, the roar of the sea and the
wild calls of the coyotes keeping silence from the
night.</p>

<p>When the coyotes ceased and the birds heralded
dawn, one Indian boy rode across at the ford and
gauged the depth of the water on his cow-pony's legs.
It was "muy bueno"&mdash;very good indeed, the water
had gone down a foot, and before the dawn broke,
the whole cavalcade was again under way. There was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
breakfast to ride for, and it was several miles across
the hills.</p>

<p>Pedro was of the opinion that there was a round-up
in the cañon of La Paz, about half-way to San Juan.
If so, there might be "carne oeco" and coffee to be
had&mdash;perhaps tortillas. The vaqueros would be
eating by dawn, but if it was possible to drive fast,
there might be hope of coffee at least.</p>

<p>So Raquel rode ahead, alert at the coming day and
the promise of it. Ana was glad to stay in the carriage
with the older women, complaining that she had
caught cold from the sea-damp. At one bend of the
road she noticed Raquel far ahead, bending low over
the neck of her horse, scanning the ground. Then
she turned out of sight under the live-oaks in a narrow
cañon, and came galloping back to the main trail as
the carriage came up.</p>

<p>"One would think you were searching the sand for
grains of gold washed down from the mountains!"
called Ana; but the girl shook her head, and rode
thoughtfully up the incline to the mesa above. She
had been noting the curious fact that the party of
vaqueros and the priest had left the trail one by one,
heading toward the hills wrapped still in the mist
of the morning.</p>

</div>

<p>At La Paz they were in time for
coffee, and Raquel, who had
ridden ahead with an Indian
boy, was told a strange story
by the Mexican cook.</p>

<p>A good breakfast had been
cooked, but the devil had got
among the horses in the night; there had been a
stampede&mdash;or something. Every one had got into
the saddle and ridden that way&mdash;up the river,&mdash;no
one had come back to tell him what it meant or to
eat the breakfast that was ready. It was cold now,
all but the coffee, but they were welcome to it.</p>

<p>He was a newcomer in the land, and had never
heard of the Doña Luisa. To the cholo the lady or
the lord of the land is often an unknown personality;
their representative, the major-domo, is the centre of
their little universe.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
But as the carriage came lurching down from the
mesa, the oldest of the vaqueros, a very black
Indian, rode back to camp, and at sight of Doña
Luisa's face white and drawn in the morning light,
he slid from his bronco, and ignoring the cook's
impatient questions stood with bent head uncovered,
until the old mistress noticed him and spoke.</p>

<p>"You are Benito, are you not?" she asked, as she
brought him to the carriage with a gesture, and rested
her hand on his to alight.</p>

<p>"Yes, señora," said the old man with grave
courtesy, though trembling with pleasure at the honor
she chose to bestow; "I am Benito. I used to break
all the horses you rode. No one else was let put a
hand on them. You do not forget; I thank you."</p>

<p>"I could not forget the things of my home. Is
there coffee? I am very glad."</p>

<p>She held her left hand against her side, and the
women exchanged frightened glances at her pallor and
the strange weakness of her voice. While she drank
the hot coffee Jacoba deftly drew the old vaquero
aside to look at a bit of broken carriage harness which
Pedro was mending with rawhide.</p>

<p>"Benito, is there no boy here to ride fast to the
Mission?" she demanded when out of hearing of the
others. "Our Doña Luisa is a sick woman, and no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
one dare say it. Some one must go and have a bed
ready&mdash;everything!"</p>

<p>"There is no boy here. The horses were run off
last night by Juan Flores or Capitan&mdash;no one knows
how many. All the men have gone that way. I
ride to the Mission. Don Rafael, he go to San
Diego to-day."</p>

<p>"To-day? Santa Maria! he may have gone! Ride
fast!"</p>

<p>"He not go yet," and the old man shrugged his
shoulders. "Too early. Army men going away.
Don Rafael make barbecue yesterday, and last night
he have a big dance for the Americanos in the
Mission."</p>

<p>"Hush! Ride fast! We will drive as slow as she
will let us. But tell Don Rafael Arteaga I say for
him to meet his mother on the road."</p>

<p>Raquel noticed the old man cantering slowly along
the level green, and heard the sound of his horse
galloping rapidly once he was out of sight past the
fringe of sycamores and low growths along the river.</p>

<p>"For what is that, Jacoba?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, some bandits have run off some horses&mdash;they
may send more vaqueros," she replied as easily
as she could with the girl watching her like that.</p>

<p>Raquel looked as though she thought all the truth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
might not be in the reply, but she turned quietly away.</p>

<p>"I would have ridden with him if I had known,"
she said, and went back to Doña Luisa, who was so
eager to continue the journey that she would wait for
no breakfast but the coffee.</p>

<p>"Cut another strap of the harness and take time to
mend it," muttered Jacoba to Pedro; "we are not all
so near to being angels that we can live without eating."</p>

<p>Thus was a little more time gained.</p>

<p>Benito made the second crossing where the river
bends around the mesa, and there met one of the boys
from the village looking for a pair of strayed mules.</p>

<p>"The Don Rafael&mdash;he has started for San Diego?"
demanded Benito. "Turn and ride with me, José."</p>

<p>The boy did so, grinning.</p>

<p>"When Don Rafael wake up to-day he much too
late to go to San Diego," he said, and the old man
uttered a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"He sleeping, then?"</p>

<p>"No one sleep in San Juan last night," said José.
"There was the supper, and some girls stay. The
army men they all start north an hour ago, but
maybe the others still dance in the Mission, Don
Rafael say he go to get married, this is his last night&mdash;no
one must sleep, or be sober!"
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
José thought it a great joke, but Benito muttered,
"Jesus and San Vicente!" and ordered the boy to go
back for the mules, and rode on down the valley
alone.</p>

<p>It took José some time to find the mules, and
when he did find them they were even more perverse
than usual; he had got them so near home as the hill
above San Juan, when one of them went careering
along the mesa as though heading for San Jacinto
mountain.</p>

<p>By the time he had secured it and got back near the
road an astonishing sight met his eyes&mdash;something
one was not used to seeing at sunrise in San Juan.</p>

<p>A carriage came down the valley road from La Paz
cañon. There were only women in it, and two Indian
boys rode in the rear. Where could a carriage
like that come from at such an hour? No one who
rode in carriages lived up those valleys!</p>

<p>In staring at the carriage he failed at first to
notice the girl on horseback, who had ridden alone in
advance of the carriage, and had halted in the road,
on the brow of the hill, looking down across the
old pueblo to the sea.</p>

<p>She was so motionless, he was very close before
he noticed her, close enough to hear her indrawn
breath of delight, to see the soft flush of emotion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
touch her face. Almost he thought there were tears
in her eyes; he thought her the most beautiful lady
he had ever seen alive,&mdash;though one picture of the
Virgin in the chapel was as fine.</p>

<p>José stopped at the sight of her and stood very
still. He could not drive mules into the road ahead
of a lady who was more lovely than even the wooden
saints with the gold painted around the border of their
gowns; and that is how he chanced to see a strange
meeting on that hill.</p>

<p>No one knew why the English señora had elected
to take a pleasure ride alone that morning, when the
message of Benito, shouted as he galloped past, had
effectually banished from the minds of Dolores and
Madalena their intended picnic at the hot springs in
the mountain, for which they were all ready, and had
actually started. But when they tumbled with delighted
exclamations from the new American buggy,
and straightway forgot all their plans for the day,
including the entertainment of their English guest,
she stared in ill-concealed irritation from one to the
other as they chattered in Spanish, scarcely enlightening
her as to the reason of the sudden change in
their plans.</p>

<p>When she finally gathered the idea that it was the
unexpected proximity of Rafael's bride-to-be, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
all the other social lights of the valley must expect to
be extinguished in her honor, the red lips of the
Englishwoman straightened a trifle, and the baby-blue
eyes took on a shade of coldness; for since her arrival
in California she had been made the centre of many
social affairs. In San Juan her one week, managed
by Teresa and Rafael, had been enough of a triumph
to cause Keith Bryton inward rage and to hold him
there as long as an excuse to stay had offered.</p>

<p>Once she said in a burst of irritated frankness:</p>

<p>"For mercy's sake, let me be happy once! You are
a dog in the manger, that's all! These people really
live! There is an empire here for the right woman,
and you need not tug at my chains to remind me that
I was fool enough to marry before I found it!"</p>

<p>And now the real ruler of the empire was about to
enter into possession, and the temporary one was
frankly forgotten! Whatever her thoughts were, she
did not mean to assist at the royal entry of those two
women whose rule meant the ignoring of the English-speaking
people.</p>

<p>Only Teresa, watching her out of beady black eyes,
comprehended and was content. Rafael had earned
the gift she had promised, but it had gone quite far
enough; it was as well Doña Luisa was coming with
the other girl!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
So, when Bryton's sister-in-law looked rather blank
and did not descend from the carriage, it was Teresa
who agreed that it <i>was</i> a morning too beautiful to
stay indoors, and of course if Doña Angela cared to
drive alone&mdash;and would excuse them&mdash;</p>

<p>Doña Angela would. She leaned back languidly,
a picture of carelessness, and motioned the driver to
go on, but her lips still held their straight hard line
as they passed the great dome of the ruined chancel,
where the birds held sovereign sway.</p>

<p>"It looks like a place for a throne," she thought,
enviously; "and a black creature from Mexico is
coming to rule it!"</p>

<p>They were crossing the bridge at the streamlet,
when an exclamation from the driver caused her to
glance ahead and see the erect slender figure on the
dark horse silhouetted against the yellow flood of
sunrise.</p>

<p>No girl of San Juan rode alone like that on the
mesa, and certainly not one would have paused like
that, transfixed by the beauty before her; there was
not one that would not rather have admired the
beautiful new buggy and the pretty hat of the fair
lady in it.</p>

<p>But the girl on the horse did not appear to notice
either any more than she had noticed José. Her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
horse had halted straight across the middle of the
road. The driver of the buggy had turned aside
before she brought her gaze back from the sea cliffs
to rest for an instant on the fair indignant face of
the Englishwoman.</p>

<p>The road was miles wide really&mdash;since one could
drive anywhere on the mesa, but the Mrs. Teddy
Bryton had heretofore seen every native step aside
from the beaten trail when she drove abroad, and she
was furious at the driver for turning his horses an iota
out of his way for that girl who looked like&mdash;what
did she look like?</p>

<p>Mrs. Bryton could not have put into words the
idea of the girl's face; but her own angry blue eyes
were caught and held for an instant by strange
fathomless violet ones&mdash;held until she shrank suddenly,
and the color left her face. Yet&mdash;as the carriage
paused, her head was still turned toward the
stranger, and José saw her put her hands suddenly
across her eyes with a gesture of repulsion or pain,
and sink back on the cushions.</p>

<p>The girl on the horse had not moved a muscle.
She might have been carved from marble, for any sign
she made after she read the angry insolence of the
blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Don Felipe Estevan's daughter," said the Mexican
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
driver, "and here ahead of the carriage of the Señora
Luisa&mdash;it must be so."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bryton gave no sign that she heard, neither
did she glance at the occupants of the carriage as
they whirled past; her mind held only one hateful
picture.</p>

<p>"Felipe Estevan's daughter" meant that she had
looked into the eyes of the "black woman from
Mexico" who had come back to her father's land to
rule, and the Mexican woman had proven not so
black as she had fancied, and had sat there on the
crest of the hill with a pride that was half regal,&mdash;and
almost half barbaric,&mdash;as though the highway was her
very own&mdash;as though the centre of it belonged to
her by divine right. Mrs. Bryton's vain soul was
fired by a momentary wild temptation to test that
divine right, to show her there was one man in San
Juan not to be ruled by anyone else if she, Angela
Bryton, cared to call him to her side and keep him
there. Should she&mdash;or should she not?</p>

<p>Teresa was quite right in her fancy that the trick
against the Americano had been quite successful
enough; it was time the other girl came to claim her own!</p>

</div>
<p>It was quite true that no one was
allowed to sleep that night of
Rafael's last bachelor supper.
Because of Miguel's death, there
could be no dancing, but the
hours passed merrily enough,
for all that. The army men
stayed until the faint gray shone in the east, when
they mounted and rode north after the horses, started
a day ahead.</p>

<p>Keith Bryton had ridden with the herd as far as
Santa Ana, and then, to Angela's amusement, returned
to San Juan. She was certain that his return
had not been for Rafael's supper, but to see that she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
did not by some man&oelig;uvre manage that it be a
ladies' supper and graced by her attendance. She
had in jest threatened to suggest it, and Keith felt
very much as Teresa felt&mdash;it was quite time the bride
were at hand to stop a flirtation bordering on the
dangerous.</p>

<p>But, after all, the ladies of San Juan were not
included. It was a carouse instead of an entertainment.
Girls were there, and guitars; and the big
Mission doors and wooden shutters inside the deep
windows barred the outer world from the hilarity, the
songs, the shrieks of laughter over toasts of the old
men to the groom-elect.</p>

<p>At earliest dawn the army men, with promises and
gold pieces to the girls, and an extra glass to Rafael
and his bride, mounted their horses and rode north to
catch up with the herd before it reached Los Angeles.
One of the girls wept lest the one who had made her
favorite might never ride that way again, and the
wilder spirits marched around her with lighted candles,
singing a funeral dirge, ending in a wild fandango.</p>

<p>Don Antonio was there, and old Ricardo Ruiz, and
they sat through the night playing with the dice, and
emptying each other's pockets in turn, and comparing
the old entertainment with the new, between the drinks.</p>

<p>The fandango ended by Concha, the weeping one,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
doing the maddest dancing of all, and Fernando
Mendez poured out goblets of wine to drink luck
to her next lover.</p>

<p>"It is good luck for himself he wants, Concha!"
called Rafael across the room. "Fernando is a coyote,
always awake for young chickens!"</p>

<p>"Concha mia, he is jealous; never heed him, but
drink wine with me to the next lover!"</p>

<p>"He offers her a glass of wine, Antonio," grunted
old Don Ricardo. "Huh!&mdash;that is the love-making
of California to-day!"</p>

<p>"True, Ricardo; at his age you or I would have
been at her feet and our jewels on her breast."</p>

<p>"Fernando has no jewels left."</p>

<p>"I should say not. His father made love after our
fashion, hence&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The deluge!"</p>

<p>"The deluge of poverty and Americanos," assented
Antonio. "A plague on them both! They have
changed the land!"</p>

<p>A burst of laughter from Rafael's end of the table
drowned the grumblings of the old men. Rafael had
told a story so very funny that the girls had shrieked
and giggled and protested behind their fans.</p>

<p>"Fie, Don Rafael! and you to be a married man
in a week!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
"But a week is seven nights away, and all of them
your own, Merced mia!"</p>

<p>"Merced!" called another man from a game of <i>malia</i>
at an old table once used for altar service&mdash;"Merced,
darling, never listen to a word he says! A paltry seven
nights! My heart is at your feet for a lifetime!"</p>

<p>"Of nights or days, señor?" asked the girl,
laughingly.</p>

<p>"She caught you there, Señor Gonzales," observed
Bryton, who was dealing the cards. "Don Rafael,
after all, makes the only definite offer."</p>

<p>"You are right, Don Keith," returned the other.
"With the help of the Americanos, Don Rafael
is learning to be a good maker of bargains."</p>

<p>"The sooner the rest of you learn the same trick,
the better for California!" retorted Rafael.</p>

<p>"You hear?" said Don Ricardo.</p>

<p>"Sure," assented the major-domo. "What if his
mother heard?"</p>

<p>"All the saints! There would be murder!"</p>

<p>"Por Dios!" exclaimed Rafael, as a servant opened
a window because of the thick tobacco smoke; "it
is daylight, and I must start for San Diego. My
last bachelor carouse is ended, and none of us under
the table!"</p>

<p>"How sad that we are still able to stand on our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
own feet!" laughed Merced. "See!" and she sprang
to the top of a beautiful silver-decorated chest against
the wall; "one of us is even able to dance good-bye
to your last night of freedom! Good-bye, O free heart
of Don Rafael! On some to-morrow the bride comes!"</p>

<p>"Holy Maria!" ejaculated Don Antonio, putting
his glass down; "she is dancing on the <i>donas</i> of the
bride!"</p>

<p>"The <i>donas</i>!" echoed Don Ricardo, aghast; "and
the bride a young saint stolen from the Church!&mdash;the
<i>donas</i>!"</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Bryton, while the rest
applauded the dancer. "<i>Donas?"</i></p>

<p>"The gifts of the groom to the bride,&mdash;the gown,
the wedding veil, the&mdash;holy God! it's sacrilege!"</p>

<p>"Is it?" asked the American; "then we'll stop it.
Come to coffee, Merced!"</p>

<p>Without further ceremony he picked the girl up
in his arms, and carried her, laughing and struggling,
into the great refectory, where the Indian servants
were placing breakfast on the table.</p>

<p>"That was quick work, Antonio," observed Don
Ricardo, with a breath of relief.</p>

<p>"Sure; he is the best of all the Americanos. Ai!
even more like the caballeros of other days than our
own sons!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Don Ricardo did not care to commit himself so
far as that. He contented himself with grumbling
at Rafael's indifference.</p>

<p>"And the girl a young saint&mdash;meant to live in
religion!"</p>

<p>Bryton rejoined them with a cup of coffee, and
both the men hastened to assure him that it was not
Rafael who was in fault, but the many glasses he
had emptied.</p>

<p>"Sure, it was the glasses," affirmed Don Ricardo.
"No man of California would let a girl of pleasure
dance on the things sacred to the woman of his
family; eh, Antonio?"</p>

<p>"Of course; at any other time Rafael would have
thrown the girl through a window; truly, he would!"</p>

<p>"No doubt of it," agreed Bryton.</p>

<p>"Doña Luisa has given the boy a long rope. It
must be that she has learned that it is too long&mdash;she
comes back after the years to steady him with a wife,&mdash;and
such a wife! Young, wealthy, beautiful!"</p>

<p>"And a young nun, all but the veil!"</p>

<p>"That seems rather a joke&mdash;or a tragedy&mdash;after all
this," and Bryton motioned to the remainders of the
night's carouse.</p>

<p>"If there is a joke, it is the devil playing it on the
saints."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
"Sure; and the devil wins," agreed Don Antonio.
"It is all settled. The Doña Luisa is a wise woman.
Her son wins a wife, and the convent loses a fortune
and a nun at the same time."</p>

<p>"Had the good son nothing to do with the
arrangement?" asked the American, dryly.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, señor. Three times he have gone
to Mexico, where Felipe Estevan's daughter visit
with his mother. He has time to sing many dozens
of serenades,&mdash;all of the burning hearts and torment
of love, and lost souls, to make a girl have pity.
Maybe she have never before talked with one young
man, one minute of her life; who knows?"</p>

<p>"It is good time she comes," observed Don
Ricardo. "One year&mdash;two years, and Rafael, like
Miguel, would be content with half-breed children
and their mother. Little Marta's child is born, and
they say she will not stay at Las Flores, where he
sent her&mdash;not for the best house there!"</p>

<p>A peal of laughter reached them from the other room.</p>

<p>"Bravo!" called Rafael; "I take you at your word,
Merced. A kiss to seal the compact!"</p>

<p>"Keep it for your wedding-day, Don Rafael," she
retorted, and ran from him through the door into the
room where the three men were talking. But Rafael
caught her inside the portal, and dragged her back,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
his face flushed and his beautiful eyes glowing.</p>

<p>"I will have it!" he muttered, with his lips against
her own. "You pretty devil, I will!"</p>

<p>"And this is the home your young nun will come
to from her convent," Bryton remarked. "Some one
said there was Indian blood in her family; it may
prove fortunate, for she will need war-clubs instead
of religion to quell this sort of thing."</p>

<p>"But with the help of her saints&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course," agreed Bryton; "with the help of her
saints all things may happen."</p>

<p>An Indian servant came in from the plaza, and
closed the door and stood with his back against it.</p>

<p>"The Doña Madalena, and Doña Dolores, and the
Señora Bryton, stop in the calesha," he announced,
stoically; "they come in!"</p>

<p>"Bar that door! they sha'n't; they must not!"
called Bryton, but it was too late. The side door
opened, and the three appeared&mdash;the two girls plainly
frightened, but Mrs. Bryton beautifully audacious.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Doña Teresa will not scold; we will
stop only a minute. Your uncle and cousin are here&mdash;it
is all right!" Then she saw Bryton, and laughed.</p>

<p>"I told you I would at least see inside," she
observed, "and it is quite worth while. What a
magnificent chest!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Bryton walked directly to her.</p>

<p>"I will see you to your carriage," he said, laying
his hand on her arm. "What the devil did you
mean by this bravado?"</p>

<p>She wrenched her arm free and regarded him coolly.</p>

<p>"Thanks. I came because I said I would come,
and you said not to dare. 'Dare' is a risky word,
amigo. We will go directly. We are going to the
hills, and only halted to wish good luck to Rafael."</p>

<p>"Malediction!" muttered Don Antonio. "He
can't be seen&mdash;he&mdash;"</p>

<p>A burst of laughter came from the dining-room,
and the two girls retreated toward the door.</p>

<p>"Women!" breathed Dolores; "if Doña Teresa
hears this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is the servants&mdash;only the servants," said Don
Antonio. "Don Rafael has perhaps started on his
journey; he will be disconsolate that&mdash;"</p>

<p>But at that moment Rafael and Fernando came in
from the dining-room, one smoothing his hair and
one arranging his cravat. Rafael was the less sober
of the two, but he managed to bow with a certain
grace as he took Mrs. Bryton's hand.</p>

<p>"My poor house is at your service, madama," he
murmured, "and I am at your feet. I hastened to
you as soon as&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
&mdash;"As soon as he could get the other girls out
the back door," remarked Fernando, aside to Bryton.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bryton was horribly cross to me for coming
in; he thinks it too unconventional; he thinks I do
not know the Spanish customs, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I offer myself as your teacher," said Rafael,
looking straight into the blue eyes. "Believe me,
señora, there are many delightful things to be learned
in old California!"</p>

<p>"I shall remember your offer," she returned, smilingly.
"See how sulky Mr. Bryton looks! He
never takes time to be gallant himself."</p>

<p>"That is true," assented Rafael. "He never looks
at the girls, or speaks except to tell them to keep quiet."</p>

<p>"Oh!" she replied, with a little malicious smile,
"there is always a girl excepted!"</p>

<p>Bryton looked at her with impatient wonder; he was
about to speak, when an Indian came in with a tray
of coffee, and Rafael offered a cup to Mrs. Bryton.</p>

<p>"Honor me, madama, and let us hear of the girl
who is an exception."</p>

<p>"Bravo! The exceptions are always of interest.
Don Keith is forever a reproach to the rest of us; he
has no vices."</p>

<p>"Or conceals them better!" put in Rafael, with a
touch of malice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
"You are to be unmasked, señor," murmured
Dolores, with lenient eyes.</p>

<p>Bryton glanced at his watch and then with
impatience at his sister-in-law.</p>

<p>"I have not the slightest idea of the lady's
meaning," he said, coldly; "and if you want to make
an early start for the hot springs&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Bryton shut her teeth together with a little
click, at his palpable ignoring of herself.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;short memory of man!" she said, chidingly;
"He has forgotten in a year!"</p>

<p>"A year?" Bryton stared at her with a puzzled
frown, and a slight motion of his hand toward the door.
That, with its little suggestion of authority, decided her.</p>

<p>"I shall tell it," she announced. "How many of
you believe in love at first sight?"</p>

<p>"All of us, after meeting you!" declared Rafael,
with an exaggerated bow.</p>

<p>"Sure!" agreed Don Ricardo.</p>

<p>"My husband, you know, is an engineer, and goes on
long journeys into queer corners of the mining world."</p>

<p>"Bad habit for husbands with pretty wives,"
remarked Don Antonio.</p>

<p>"Last Winter," continued she, slowly sipping her
coffee and watching Bryton; "last Winter he went to
Mexico."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
"Pardon! We do not ask for the love affairs of
your lucky husband, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But last Winter Don Keith went along; yes&mdash;he
went along to look up some mining property in the
Indian hills, and when he came back&mdash;Have
any of you noticed the peculiar ring Mr. Bryton
wears?"</p>

<p>"Angela!" said Keith, sharply; but she looked at
him with smiling insolence.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know your little romance of Doña
Espiritu; Teddy told me."</p>

<p>"Damn Teddy!" he remarked, while the rest
shouted with laughter at the color flaming in his face.</p>

<p>"Doña Espiritu!" repeated Don Ricardo. "The
lady of the Spirit&mdash;let us hope it was a good spirit,
Don Keith&mdash;and that she was kind!"</p>

<p>"To her health!" cried Rafael. "Pour brandy,
Fernando; we drink our last toast of this meeting to
the love of Don Keith&mdash;to the Doña Espiritu!"</p>

<p>"I would rather see the ring than drink the toast,"
said Dolores. "May I, señor?"</p>

<p>"There is nothing remarkable about it, except
that it is very, very old," and he held out his hand for
her inspection. "An onyx engraved with the Aztec
eagle&mdash;now the Mexican eagle."</p>

<p>"But given him by&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
"By a lady who was of service to my brother, to
an old priest, and to me."</p>

<p>"See how he drags in the others," laughed Mrs.
Bryton. "Teddy and the priest got no ring; Ted
had a knife-thrust, and the priest a black eye. Keith
had some hurt on the head, from which he had a long
and interesting case of fever."</p>

<p>"Let us hope Doña Espiritu nursed him through
it, and the priest did not watch them too closely,"
remarked Rafael, with a meaning glance at Bryton.
The last drink of brandy had been the one too many,
and his smile was not nice.</p>

<p>"Did she nurse him through the illness?" whispered
Madalena in Angela's ear.</p>

<p>"Oh, I could tell," said the latter, demurely; "but
Keith evidently resents his romances being made
public."</p>

<p>"Señorita, there is no more to tell," remarked Keith,
coldly; "not even so much as Angela would suggest.
My brother and an old priest and I lost our way in
the hills; and seeing a light, we chanced on some
religious meeting of a strange hill tribe of Indians.
They thought we were spies of the Church or the
government, and there was trouble. A lady, whom
the Indians and the priest called by the name you
heard, saved us all that night. She was the one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
person of the Catholic Church they would allow
to know them well, and she was a nun or a novice."</p>

<p>"Santa Maria! and she gave you rings?"</p>

<p>"The ring was some talisman respected by the
tribe. She put it on my finger after I had been struck
down and&mdash;well&mdash;used up. It stopped them when
words were of no use. We made a litter for the old
priest, and tied Teddy on a burro,&mdash;he had a leg
wound,&mdash;and we walked beside them over the wilderness
trail until dawn came, and we met help.
I fainted from loss of blood about that time, and
Teddy and I recuperated in the house of the old
priest. We never saw the lady again."</p>

<p>"You never saw her again after an adventure like
that!" cried Fernando in amaze. "That is cold blood
for you!"</p>

<p>"It may be that she was ugly&mdash;or old," suggested
Rafael.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, she was so charming that he
shouted for her in the delirium of the fever; that is
how Teddy learned that she was the one exception
among girls! But all their scheming could not learn
her name from the priest or the Mexicans. 'Doña
Espiritu' was all they ever heard. Teddy fancied they
had shipped her to Spain for the adventure with a
heretic that one night."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
"Is it all true, señor?" asked Dolores. "Doña
Angela laughs at it, and you frown; and between the
two, how are we to know how serious it may all be
to you?"</p>

<p>"Serious enough to make him bare his head at
every old battered shrine for her sake," said Angela,
with a little shrug; "and an old ring of his mother's
was lost from his finger on that wilderness trail, while
the Mexican eagle took its place. Oh, nuns are
only women after all, and much can happen in the
length of a Mexican night!"</p>

<p>"Well, señor," said Dolores, with sudden courage,
"I am a good Catholic, thank God! and I see no
sacrilege in the sort of love for which a man bares his
head at a shrine. Señor Bryton, the story will make
us of California more than ever your friends!"</p>

<p>"Sure," agreed Don Antonio.</p>

<p>"I am at your feet, señorita," said Bryton, with
kindly deference. "Now, Mrs. Bryton, if you have
no other&mdash;romances&mdash;to elaborate and embellish,
perhaps you will allow me to see you to your carriage,
before I start for Los Angeles. Don Rafael is detained
by us when he should be on his way south,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I beg&mdash;" began Rafael, but Madalena
interrupted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
"Not another moment must we stay. Aunt
Teresa will scold us well for this!"</p>

<p>"For taking pity on a lonely bachelor?" asked
Rafael.</p>

<p>"Lonely?" repeated Dolores. "We will come
again when the bride comes. Until then we leave
you to prepare your soul with this&mdash;and this!"</p>

<p>She motioned to the decanter, and picked up the
scarlet fan of Mercedes.</p>

<p>"You cruel one! You would make Doña Angela
think&mdash;but do not think it, madama! I assure you,
it is my mother's&mdash;or my aunt's&mdash;or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He never had an aunt," laughed Madalena.
"Come, Uncle Ricardo, Doña Maxima wants you
at home; she is at our house saying things to make
your ears burn."</p>

<p>"Sure!" said Don Ricardo, getting on his feet and
taking the cane offered him. "But it is in honor
of Doña Luisa Arteaga I am here. When her son
makes gay company, it is the time for the steady
friends of the family to stay by. So I am here, Madalena
mia; and I shall say to my wife I was here all
the evening, right here at this table as a respectable
friend, and won seventy pesos!"</p>

<p>"Sure, he did," assented Don Antonio. "But it is
over! The sun is up, it is good time to go home."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Rafael managed in the farewells to kiss the hand
of Mrs. Bryton twice, and to be observed by Bryton
only once. That was enough of victory for the moment,
and when the door was closed he flung himself
into a chair and reached again for the decanter.</p>

<p>"Ai! she is delicious&mdash;the madama whose husband
plans mines and goes on long voyages! How
she makes our women look tame!"</p>

<p>"Tah! She is insolent, that is all. We would
lock up our women if they had the American way.
Drink coffee&mdash;not more brandy."</p>

<p>"To the devil with your coffee! And it is not an
American way&mdash;she is English&mdash;the delicious lady!"</p>

<p>"Worse still!" grunted Fernando.</p>

<p>"How?" roared Rafael, straightening up in his chair.
"You forget, señor! She is my friend&mdash;my very illustrious
friend&mdash;she is&mdash;no matter what she is. Her husband
goes on long voyages&mdash;and you must apologize
to me&mdash;you hear? I have the admiration for her&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are drunk; that is what ails you, Rafael,"
said his friend, bluntly. "You think that you are
in love with that woman, but you are only drunk."</p>

<p>"Drunk&mdash;I? And you call her&mdash;call the illustrious
lady who is a friend of mine, 'that woman!' Señor,
there are two swords on the wall. You take your
choice&mdash;you&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Fernando tried to avoid him, but he wrenched the
sword from the wall and lunged at him wickedly.</p>

<p>But for a girl who shrieked and rushed from a
shadowy doorway, and flung herself on the arm of
Rafael, it would have gone ill with Fernando.</p>

<p>"Rafael mio!" she cried, clinging to him, "for the
love of God!"</p>

<p>"Marta!" he cried, and dropped the weapon. "I&mdash;did
I not tell you&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off vaguely, and avoided Fernando's
eyes; that young man laughed good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"Another illustrious friend whose husband goes on
long voyages!" he said, lightly. "I leave you, my
friend, until you are sober. Señorita, adios."</p>

<p>Rafael stared moodily at the girl. She was a pretty
bit of bronze flesh with passionate eyes.</p>

<p>"I told you to stay on the ranch," he said at last;
but she broke into tears and caught his hands.</p>

<p>"I could not! They all know&mdash;the old woman
and the priest. They thought I was dying, and he
came and I had to tell him the name of the child's
father; and&mdash;and when my own father comes back
from the herding he will beat me, and I will not
stay! I will not! He is not a fine gentleman,
Rafael; he is only a herder who was a soldier in
Mexico. Fine words would not count with him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
unless it would be words before the priest, and you
promised&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jesus, Maria, and Joseph!" burst out Rafael.
"What an hour to come with a list of a man's promises!
I've been up all night, and I'd fight with the
saints if they came my way. Go, Marta; I will tell
Antonio to make a home for you away from the crazy
herder. I&mdash;I am very busy; I start south in an
hour."</p>

<p>"But, Rafael&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;well?"</p>

<p>"They say you are to marry an illustrious señorita&mdash;that
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They say a lot there is no sense in saying!" he
burst out angrily. "If you had stayed on the ranch,
you would not have heard their lies or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ai! I am happy that it is not true. But that
one lady&mdash;whose hands you kissed&mdash;Rafael&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, for the love of God, go!" he said. "You
women drive a man mad! You&mdash;"</p>

<p>Fernando rushed in, interrupting him:</p>

<p>"Rafael! Your mother&mdash;she is here!"</p>

<p>"My mother?"</p>

<p>"On the hill&mdash;her carriage&mdash;a man brings the
news."</p>

<p>"Damnation! Coming here&mdash;now? And my head&mdash;Yes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
it's true, Fernando; I was drunk. Help me
to think! Make them clear all this away!" and he
pointed to the tables and the dice and the cards on
the floor. "Por Dios, how my head swims! And
my mother is no fool&mdash;she will see! Think, Fernando!
Help me to plan something. And you,
Marta, let yourself not be seen!"</p>

<p>The frightened girl was only too glad to slip away,
while the rest of the group stripped the rooms of evidences
of the night's orgy.</p>

<p>"Mount a horse and ride to the beach," decided
Fernando. "You will be gone on business, to see
about&mdash;eh&mdash;to see if the vessel for hides has come
in. Make yourself decent, and I will send a messenger
after you. Don't be too easily found&mdash;you are
likely to be drunker in an hour than you are now."</p>

<p>"Curse the brandy! And Bryton was to come back
to see me about&mdash;oh, God knows what! But don't
let my mother see him&mdash;an accursed heretic Americano,
you know! Dios! If I could only sleep for
an hour!"</p>

<p>Fernando fairly pushed him out at the door.</p>

<p>"Take a sea bath; drink black coffee; get out of
sight while I receive the bride!"</p>

<p>Then, after the door was closed on the groom-elect,
he took a quick survey of the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
"That is right, open all the windows. Some one
cut lilies&mdash;the white ones&mdash;quick! Hide this fan for
Merced. Light those candles on the Virgin's shrine,
and put the lilies there and on the table. Whose pipe
is this under the edge of our lady's lace robe? It
smells vilely&mdash;take it away! Where is the key of
the chest of the <i>donas</i>? Here it is in the chest, and
that is unlocked&mdash;only Rafael could do that. Let us
hope he has not let Merced try on the wedding-dress!
Are there no more flowers? Get some for the room
of the señorita. Tell some one to make French coffee.
Manuel, put out the light."</p>

<p>Dolores and Madalena ran through the open door,
breathless.</p>

<p>"Fernando, she is here&mdash;the Señora Arteaga,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Already! Aunt Teresa told us to run and help;
she will come also. Don Rafael?"</p>

<p>"Has ridden to the harbor."</p>

<p>"More likely to bed," remarked Madalena, skeptically.</p>

<p>"Señorita!"</p>

<p>"Sh&mdash;h!" whispered Dolores, with lifted hand.
"The carriage; they are in the plaza!"</p>

<p>She rushed out, and the others followed. Teresa
was there greeting Doña Luisa; but all fell suddenly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
silent as they noticed the gray-white of the old face,
and the frail figure as she descended from the carriage
with the help of Fernando Mendez and Ana&mdash;his
cousin's widow.</p>

<p>Fernando cast one glance at the girl who sat her
horse and glanced over their heads for the face she
did not see.</p>

<p>A wizened old Indian woman alighted from a cart
and came to her and touched her foot on the stirrup.</p>

<p>"It is your new land, little mistress," she said, in a
tongue not understood by the others, "the land of
your handsome lover."</p>

<p>The girl looked again across the many faces gathering
in the plaza, and then accepted the help of Don
Antonio to alight.</p>

<p>"But he is not here, Polonia&mdash;the handsome lover,"
she returned, and then walked past all the others and
slipped her hand under the arm of Doña Luisa.</p>

<p>"A thousand welcomes, señora," said Fernando,
at the portal. "The town will rejoice to-day."</p>

<p>"One welcome I had a right to expect at this door,"
the old lady answered, "and he is not here."</p>

<p>"He will be heart-broken. He did not think you
had yet reached San Diego. To-day he was to start
for there. Will it please you to have this seat?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," she said. "Raquelita!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Raquel Estevan gently disengaged her other hand
from Dolores, and the frail old woman led her to the
little shrine of the Virgin, where the candles glimmered.
The others halted at the door, but Fernando
and Dolores and Ana knelt also as the old woman
and the girl from Mexico clasped hands and bent
heads before the statue in the niche.</p>

<p>The old woman rose first and kissed the girl's
forehead.</p>

<p>"My daughter," she said, faintly, "I welcome you
for my son and for myself, to the land where you are
mistress. Now, señor!"</p>

<p>Fernando placed a chair for her, and she sank into
it wearily.</p>

<p>"My last journey, my children! You are the son
of Manuel Mendez?&mdash;we called ourselves cousins
once. I present you&mdash;all of you&mdash;to my daughter&mdash;Doña
Raquel Estevan."</p>

<p>"At your feet, señorita!" said Fernando.</p>

<p>"I appreciate the honor of your acquaintance,
señor," replied Raquel, in the conventional greeting
of the day and land. Then the others crowded about,
and spoke many pretty things of welcome. But in the
midst of it all Doña Luisa arose, and leaning on
Jacoba's arm, passed into the room prepared for her.
The group left behind stared into each other's eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
"How frail! How could any creature like that
make the journey?" asked Fernando. "She has
been very ill."</p>

<p>"She <i>is</i> ill; we dare not mention it to her!"</p>

<p>"But Rafael&mdash;her son&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Must not be told, so she says; not until the
wedding is over. All at once she has gone like that.
It is the heart, señor, and she is old. It may be
months&mdash;may be days&mdash;may be only hours, and
we can do nothing but keep her quiet and happy."</p>

<p>"Santa Maria!" muttered Dolores, "and Rafael&mdash;"</p>

<p>"His heart it will break&mdash;no? To not see him
at the door is like a bad omen. She likes not the
new Americanos' way of business&mdash;to be gone at
breakfast time to look at ships! But of course he
is very good!"</p>

<p>"You are very good," replied Dolores. "Have
they sent for Rafael?"</p>

<p>"I will see," said Fernando, and went away muttering,
"The so good Rafael!"</p>

<p>"Oh! we have a thousand things to ask you,
Raquel," said Madalena. "Could you have been a
nun and been happy if&mdash;Rafael had not found you?"</p>

<p>"To work for Mother Church&mdash;is not that of
happiness?"</p>

<p>"Never to dance! Never to hear a serenade!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Never to watch on moonlight nights for a handsome
caballero!"</p>

<p>"I would as soon live in a tomb," confessed
Dolores.</p>

<p>"But if you had never seen a dance, would you
miss dancing? My mother's people were priests;
she was to have been a nun. My blood and my
teaching have been of the church. My life has been
lived in one little narrow strip of the world. All at
once the world changed. Sometimes it bewilders me,
this change. You say 'happy,' but I don't think
I know that word as you know it. Maybe I never
shall learn it&mdash;who knows? But I can find work for
the Church even here in the world, and you will all
be my good friends, and&mdash;I shall be content."</p>

<p>Doña Luisa had entered the room while she was
speaking, and nodded her approval.</p>

<p>"Content? You will be happy, my child; you will
be with Rafael! Have you seen the chest of the
<i>donas</i>? Is it not handsome? If we only had the
key!"</p>

<p>"There is a little silver key on the shrine," said
Dolores, and ran to get it.</p>

<p>"Aha! On the shrine of the Virgin!" said Doña
Luisa. "Is that not love, Raquelita?"</p>

<p>"I am willing to believe it," she said, and took the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
little key, only to hand it back to Dolores. "You
open it&mdash;and may you be the next happy bride!"</p>

<p>Dolores rushed to unlock the chest, and Madalena
to lift the lid, and Ana, as well as the older women,
exclaimed at the richness of the contents.</p>

<p>"Ai! Raquel Estevan, thou happy one!" cried
Ana; "you have more luck than a queen!"</p>

<p>They pulled out embroideries and laces and jewels,
with little shrieks of ecstasy at the beauty and fineness
of them. Raquel looked on, smiling at their delight.</p>

<p>"Aha! is not that a lover, Raquelita?" repeated
Doña Luisa. "Bring me the mantillas. Those two
are for the bridesmaids; see how they look on
Madalena and Dolores&mdash;fine&mdash;fine! And here is the
wedding-veil&mdash;and the shoes, and the rosary&mdash;not
anything is forgotten! He is so dear, so good&mdash;my
Rafael!"</p>

<p>The girls insisted on placing the wreath and veil
on Raquel's head, but she broke from them at sight
of a silken scarf of green and red and white.</p>

<p>"Ah! more than all the jewels!" she cried, and
clasped it to her bosom. "The flag of my own
Mexico! I will love him for that&mdash;I will love him
with all my heart!"</p>

<p>"Ah! thou hast said it at last," said Doña Luisa,
in triumph; "never forget thou hast said it!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
"When I say it," whispered Dolores to Ana, "it
will be to the man, not to his mother."</p>

<p>"Come to me, daughter," said Doña Luisa, sinking
back into a chair. "The heart feels&mdash;feels almost
too happy! My dear Raquel&mdash;my dear Rafael!"</p>

<p>"The Americanos will be crazy to see this wedding
in the old California fashion," said Madalena, adjusting
Raquel's veil caressingly. "Señora Bryton would
give her two ears&mdash;ouch! Doña Ana, you break my
arm!"</p>

<p>"Give thanks it is not your neck, babbler!" muttered
Ana. Doña Luisa looked at the two intently
a moment.</p>

<p>"Who is the American señora of the two ears?"
she inquired; "and why should the wedding of my
son have interest for such&mdash;persons?"</p>

<p>"She&mdash;she was a cousin of Don Eduardo, and now
she is married again&mdash;and she visits us, and her
husband is some kind of engineer to make railroads,
and mines, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>A pinch from Dolores stopped her this time, but it
was very clumsily done, Doña Luisa saw it.</p>

<p>"Ah," she said, quietly; "and when is he to bring
the railroad of the Americanos to the Californias, eh?"</p>

<p>The women and girls stared at each other.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I cannot tell her," murmured Madalena to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Jacoba; "you speak! Of course it is not Doña
Angela's husband who does it, but&mdash;the railroad does
come&mdash;so they say."</p>

<p>"Why do you whisper, and not speak aloud?"
demanded Doña Luisa, putting aside the hand of
Raquel, who tried to quiet her rising resentment.
"Is there not anyone here to speak plainly, and the
truth? What is it you try to hide from me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Luisa," begged Jacoba, tearfully, "do not
make of this a thing to trouble you! No one tries
really to hide things; it is not here the railroad is to
be first; it is only talk; it may never happen&mdash;it
may&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where?" demanded Doña Luisa. And Jacoba,
with tears in her eyes, confessed having heard of the
impertinence of the Americanos, who meant to
build a new road of their own instead of the wagon
trail to San Antonio.</p>

<p>"That was good enough for our fathers. What is
now wrong with the San Antonio road?"</p>

<p>"Not anything, of course; but the government&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah ha!" and the old voice lifted to a shrill note
of triumph in having at last found the key of the
question. "The American government! I thought
that would be it. What new crime do they plan
against the Californias? This it is to grow old and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
lame&mdash;they would hide it from me! Speak, and tell
me all! Does the fine new government want my
home to quarter their pigs of soldiers in, as they did
in the Mission in other days? And would my
friends have hidden it from me until these upstarts
were across my door?"</p>

<p>"Luisa&mdash;chulita&mdash;you were not well. Rafael said
you were not to be told; but since you think we mean
to speak falsely, or deceive you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where is it to come? How near?" Doña Luisa
was not to be led an iota from the main question.
But at her demand, Jacoba tried to speak, and failed,
and could only weep noisily at the hardness in her old
cousin's tones.</p>

<p>"Why do you make Aunt Jacoba weep like that?"
demanded Ana, resentfully. "What has she to do
with the railroads&mdash;she or her family? Your good
Rafael does more to bring them than any one else.
He sells them land; he and Don Eduardo help them
to get the rights to go where they please. Aunt
Jacoba would not do that; her father and her husband
would be burned at the stake before they would
help these new people to use the graves of the holy
fathers at San Gabriel as a road-bed!"</p>

<p>"Mother of God!"</p>

<p>Doña Luisa arose, as though to annihilate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
daring speaker; but Raquel caught her and she sank
back in her chair with one tremulous hand extended
to the frightened Ana.</p>

<p>"Go on!" she said, hoarsely. "Go on! Perjure
thy soul with lies, since thou lovest them so,&mdash;lies
against a son of Mother Church. Go on!"</p>

<p>Ana shrank, and faltered, but the accusation
brought back her courage.</p>

<p>"If the truth is shameful, the shame is not mine,"
she retorted. "Through two of the Arteaga ranches
in the north has Rafael sold the right of way for the
American railroad to Monterey. That it might come
closer to his ranch-houses, he has let it be built across
the forgotten graves of the Mission fathers. Beneath
the feet of the Americanos will lie the holy apostles
of our Mother Church! The Protestant heretics will
wheel their pigs to market across the gardens where
Ava Marias have sounded all the years of religion in
California!"</p>

<p>Doña Luisa stared at her with white face, and her
lips moved stiffly when she tried to speak. The
other women and girls were clinging together in tears,
and Raquel stood with her strong young arms about
her, as though to guard her against the world.</p>

<p>Bryton, who had strolled back through the patio
for a final word with Rafael, had heard nothing of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
arrivals; he pushed open the door at the back, and
then halted at the sight of the group there,&mdash;the
women and girls frightened and weeping, the scattered
wealth of silks and laces flung across chairs and tables,
and the three girls with bride-like veils.</p>

<p>"Is it&mdash;a witchcraft?" half whispered Doña Luisa
at last; but the whisper was plainly heard above the
sobs of the girls, who scarcely dared to breathe. "It
is a work of the fiends to snare his soul for hell
Immaculate Mother, let it not be!"</p>

<p>Raquel bent above her with murmured assurances
of divine help, and the old woman suddenly caught
the hands of the girl in her own and held her, staring
in her face with questioning eyes; then she spoke
eagerly, fiercely.</p>

<p>"Your wish but a moment ago! You wished for
some great work for Mother Church&mdash;to fight evil
out in the world; your guardian angel heard the wish
and has sent you a soul to save from the heretics,&mdash;the
soul of the man you love!"</p>

<p>Raquel stared at her, but did not speak. Her eyes
looked a bit frightened, but she rested her cheek on
the frail old hands, and caressed them reassuringly.</p>

<p>Doña Luisa lifted the gold and ebony crucifix,
and held it above her head.</p>

<p>"Kneel!" she said; and the girls and women did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
so. Bryton, in the doorway, caught sight of the girl
in the bride's veil, and made a movement toward her,
but was checked by the voice of the mother.</p>

<p>"It is for the soul of the man you love, Raquel
mia. Never forget that&mdash;never forget!"</p>

<p>"I will not forget," said the girl, gently; and at the
sound of the voice Keith Bryton's jaw set in a tense,
ugly way, and he stepped back into the shadow.</p>

<p>"Then swear by the Holy Mother of God!" said
the old voice, and the crucifix above the head of the
kneeling girl was held rigidly steady.</p>

<p>"I swear by the Holy Mother of God!"</p>

<p>"Swear by the blood of Christ crucified!"</p>

<p>"I swear by the blood of Christ crucified!"</p>

<p>"To stand as a guard over the soul of Rafael!"
The old voice had a faintness, despite the steady
words; the end of her strength had come.</p>

<p>The eyes of Raquel widened ever so little as she
realized what she was promising. There was an
involuntary pause before she spoke again, and then
the absolute despair of the mother, and her one hope,
swept over the girl's consciousness, and a spark
of the martyr fire lit her own soul.</p>

<p>"To stand as guard over the soul of Rafael,"
said she, steadily.</p>

<p>"So long as you both shall live!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
"So long as&mdash;we both&mdash;shall&mdash;live."</p>

<p>Then the crucifix fell to the tiled floor, and the
old face looked very gray, as she sank back on the
chair; and Jacoba smothered a shriek at sight of
her eyes; and Raquel, still on her knees, clasped her
about the waist and whispered:</p>

<p>"Doña Luisa, Doña Luisa!"</p>

<p>The staring eyes regained a momentary glimmer of
consciousness at the sound of the girl's voice, and she
lifted her hand again as though it still held the crucifix.</p>

<p>"Until&mdash;the day&mdash;of&mdash;" and then the sentence
trailed along into the eternal silences of the unseen
land.</p>

<p>"Señora!" called Raquel, appealingly; but Ana
caught her by the shoulder and looked in her face,
and said:</p>

<p>"God help you, Raquel Estevan! To the recording
angel she has taken that oath."</p>

<hr />

<p>Keith Bryton closed the door on the weeping
women, and walked out through the old refectory to
the inner court, where he met Fernando.</p>

<p>"What is it, señor?" he asked. Bryton looked at
him much as though he had not been there.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I scarcely know," he said, dully. "You had better&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
"But you have the face of a ghost!" interrupted
Fernando. "Something has happened&mdash;in there?"</p>

<p>"I think so," agreed the American, recovering under
Fernando's curious gaze. "Some one is ill&mdash;or&mdash;"</p>

<p>Fernando ran past him, and Bryton walked slowly
along the inner court to where the one-time baptistry
lay roofless to the sky. Through an old doorway
with the Aztec sun cut in the coping, he passed
into the old graveyard of the padres, and thence to
the great altar-place of the old earthquake ruin.
Even there the cries of the girls came to him through
an open window&mdash;a wailing chorus of tragedy. Then
an old Indian untied the ropes of the belfry, and
the toll of death sounded along the valley. But
it seemed very far away. He stared at the half-pagan
decorations of the old stonework&mdash;never the
cross of Christ anywhere on them&mdash;and sat so still
that two linnets lit almost at his feet and were not
afraid.</p>

<p>"I wondered why I should stray back to this little
corner of the world," he said at last, "and now&mdash;now
I reckon I'm finding out. God! I feel like a
bad dream. And my hands tied!"</p>

<p>He paced back and forth on the old altar-place,
until the mad clatter of hoofs coming from the sea
cut across the tolling of the bells and told him the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
lost bridegroom&mdash;the man she said she loved and
would never forget&mdash;had been found.</p>

<p>He swore softly as he crossed the plaza to the
veranda of Juan Alvara. The old man, rolling his
first cigarro of the day, was sitting there on the bench
in the early sunlight.</p>

<p>"Don Juan," he said, holding out his hand,
"I ride to catch up with the officers and go with
them into the Indian country, and I may not see
San Juan again for a long time. Your home has
always been a pleasant place, and I thank you for
many courtesies."</p>

<p>The old man shook his hand gravely.</p>

<p>"Adios! You come back to San Juan&mdash;no?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," said Bryton. "If there is anything
I can do for you in Los Angeles&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thanks, señor; there is nothing. My daughters
go there in a week with the wedding party. For
whom think you old Tomás tolls the bell?"</p>

<p>When informed, he stared vaguely at the Americano.
Alvara was growing old. Teresa had warned them
all that no one should tell him until his breakfast
was over and he had had his smoke.</p>

<p>"Luisa! the Doña Luisa! Dead, you say?&mdash;before
the wedding-day? No, señor, pardon, but you have
not understood. I know Luisa Arteaga when she is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
still a little girl&mdash;and always. She not dying before
she have marry the boy like she want."</p>

<p>Still, his hand trembled as he reached for his cane.
Across the plaza Indians and Mexicans were moving
toward the Mission. It was early for San Juan to be
astir in the street. Old Matia, who had been nurse
to Miguel and Rafael, went past, not seeing the two
men for the tears in her eyes. Yes&mdash;after all, there
was trouble&mdash;but Doña Luisa!</p>

<p>In his perturbation he turned, and again held out
his hand.</p>

<p>"Adios, señor," he repeated; "but you coming
back for sure. To San Juan all people coming back
some time. You go with the horses across the
deserts?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am going across the deserts. Adios!"</p>

<p>He had crossed the ranges twice
and returned, but the City of the
Angels had lost its old witchery.</p>

<p>The rose-tinted dawns, and
the amethystine dusks were
beautiful as ever, but to banish
the memories he had once
dreamed over there, he galloped alone to the harbor
called "The Hell of California," and lay all one
day on the beach, and stared moodily at the waves
whipping the yellow sands of San Pedro.</p>

<p>To the south there, far beyond the prosaic stretch
of grazing-lands bordered by the sea, beyond all the
tame levels where the water was green or yellow in
the shallows, beyond all the jutting points, veiled in
the miles of mists, he could follow in his mind each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
curve, until the one valley of beauty would gleam
like a green jewel seen from the cliffs of San Juan.</p>

<p>And at the foot of those cliffs there were no flat
stretches of color such as make weary the eye; the
water there held all the shimmering, bewitching,
iridescence of a peacock's feathers,&mdash;the gold and
purple, the greens and the blues ever changing,&mdash;the
strange touch of pink making it all glorious in certain
glints of the sunlight; and at the edge of it all, the
fringe of foam&mdash;a string of pearls shattered on the
brown cliffs or sandy beach, and gathered up to be
dashed again and again and again&mdash;the endless garniture
of old Ocean's robe.</p>

<p>Never on any other shore had mere waves, running
to the sand, the same witchery. Alvara had said that
all men came back some day to San Juan. What
witchery was it by which its mesa and its valley and
its wonderful shore were forever set apart from other
shores of California? Some mystery of life brooded
there from sea to mountain, suggesting so much which
was left for poor humanity to solve; it was only a
whispered suggestion, dim and delightful, as the music
of the waves heard from the Mission plaza, or as dreamy
as the high film of fog, drifting high up and tempering
the sun's rays until they fell softly as a benediction
on the valley between blue sea and blue summit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
His own life stretched before him like the brown
levels and yellow flatness of San Pedro; and there to
the south, miles across the ranges, was the heart of the
dreamland he must not enter: another man had that
claim under fence. He gave voice to some self-condemnation
of a sort reserved for men who go <i>loco</i>
over a woman who forgets, and after hours of brooding
there alone by the shore, arrived at only one
decision&mdash;the California of the south ranges was no
longer his own. All the width of it was now narrowed
to one little valley, where the poppies flamed over
forgotten graves and adobe walls, and the doves circled
above a ruined chancel.</p>

<p>He rode into town, where some kind friends
mentioned that Don Rafael Arteaga and his bride
were being <i>fêted</i> by the leading Spanish families of
Los Angeles, and he was invited to a dinner in their
honor a week hence.</p>

<p>"I go to Mexico&mdash;I start to-day," he answered,
briefly. Ten minutes before, he had not thought of it.</p>

<p>"To Mexico? You cover ground fast these days,
Don Keith. On the new road of iron they mean to
make, you could not go so much faster than on the
horses you ride; you have the good American luck in
the pick of them."</p>

<p>"Yes, the good American luck!" said Keith Bryton,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
with a touch of bitterness. "May your saints send
you a better!"</p>

<p>A man who stood near, and who much desired the
invitation Bryton had refused, shrugged his shoulders
as the Americano mounted his horse and rode away.</p>

<p>"What better luck could a man have, than a
chance to meet Doña Raquel Estevan de Arteaga?" he
queried of any who might care to answer. "The
bishop himself shows her honor, and they say she
is working for the Church against Downing, the
Englishman, who holds the Mission lands under
Pico's sale. Sixteen years has the Church fought for
those lands in the courts; if she gets them back,
she deserves the pope's blessing. And the fool boy
of an Americano rides south when he could meet
her&mdash;perhaps touch her hand!"</p>

<p>But the fool Americano rode south and kept on riding
south for many dusty days. He crossed a corner
of the Yaqui country, and then across the ranges
to the old mine, called the Mine of the Temple&mdash;the
one of which he had told Don Juan Alvara&mdash;was
it so few weeks ago? It might have been years
instead of weeks, by his own feeling and attitude
of mind. He was riding back a different man.
He evaded the few Mexicans as he neared the mine;
no turn of the trail was lonely for him. Memory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
kept pace, and the murmur of one girl's voice spoke
through the rustling leaves of the mountains.</p>

<p>A travelling priest, jubilant at the idea of comradeship,
hailed him in one of the mountain passes, and
found him but a sorry companion.</p>

<p>"This is a country," said the padre, "where the
sight of a white face is most welcome. Six months
since I was sent to this parish, and few of them
have I seen. Now, I ride out of my way just to talk
with an American who works a mine up here. Your
brother, is it? Well, he has a good name with the
brown folks. A lot of pagans they are! It is not
a priest they need here; it is a missionary the bishop
should send to teach them their religion anew.
If ever they had any, it has been lost."</p>

<p>But it was evidently the opinion of the padre
that they had never really secured any to lose.
He discoursed at some length on the failure of the
Church to impress upon them the advantage of marriage.
Few were the wedding fees to be obtained
from the Mexicans, while the heathen Indians had
some form of their own, arranged by the head of their
clan, and it was a disgrace to a land held under cross
and crown for two centuries&mdash;an endless shame!</p>

<p>Keith assented, without heeding the list of Indian
iniquities. He was rather glad, after all, that Teddy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
had a civilized neighbor, willing to be companionable.
Teddy liked people too well to exile himself from
them but for the one thing&mdash;to go back north,
able to cover one white throat with pearls, or two
white hands with diamonds.</p>

<p>His greeting of his half-brother was a bit shy,
though wholly glad, and the padre served to bridge
over the first few awkward moments. Both men
recognized the fact of a change in each since the
Los Angeles days. Teddy thought it due only to his
clandestine marriage, and Keith felt guilty as he
realized how little, how very little, Teddy's marriage
meant to him now. While the padre was getting
acquainted with the Mexican, the two brothers walked
apart, and talked of the chances of the mine's success,
and the failure of the backers to see the necessity of
using money more freely on the enterprise.</p>

<p>"It's there, you know," insisted Teddy; "all this
district is flooded with stories of the ore taken out of
it in the first days of the Spaniards; then the Indians
descended upon them, and there was a slaughter, and
no Spaniard dared venture into these hills for a
century."</p>

<p>"Yes. We put in a good many fruitless days
trailing those old legends," assented Keith, "but
only the Indian superstition tends to show that this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
is the real mine of that history. The rich one may
not have been on this side of the mountain, since you
have not yet struck the lode."</p>

<p>"Don't let's talk about it, if you feel that way,"
suggested Teddy, "I hear plenty of that from the
others; and you didn't really come all the way down
here to talk mines. Say, old chap, you acted like
a prince over the&mdash;well, the wedding. I felt pretty
nearly three inches higher when I got your letter. I&mdash;I
know I acted like a kid, but Angela wanted it arranged
so; and&mdash;as she about filled the whole horizon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cut out the explanation, Teddy. A man is never
sure of himself until the right woman crosses his
trail&mdash;or the wrong one. God knows I'm not fit for
alcalde in the case. At least, you married your wife."</p>

<p>Teddy stared at him an instant, and then shouted
with laughter.</p>

<p>"Married my wife? Well, rather! How else
could she be my wife?"</p>

<p>Keith avoided the frank boyish blue eyes of
Teddy, and turned away, seating himself on a great
bowlder and staring across the little semicircle of the
cañon basin, to where gnarled century-old trees reached
grotesque arms above some old stone ruins and fragments
of marble. Teddy looked at him an instant,
and then whistled softly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
"If it were any other man than you, Keith, I'd
think&mdash;but it's too ridiculous!"</p>

<p>"Say it," suggested Keith.</p>

<p>"Well, I'd say the wrong woman had crossed <i>your</i>
trail."</p>

<p>"Not the wrong one."</p>

<p>"Good Lord! you don't mean that by any chance
it is at last the right one?"</p>

<p>"At last&mdash;the right woman."</p>

<p>"And you sit there looking as solemn over it as
a wooden Mexican god! Wake up, old fellow, and
tell about her."</p>

<p>"There is nothing to tell. She is the right woman,
and I shall never see her again."</p>

<p>"Keith!"</p>

<p>"And I've come back here to tell myself so,"
continued Keith, doggedly; "to say it over and over,
and beat it into my brain, if I have any left. The
desert didn't help me&mdash;I thought this might."</p>

<p>"This?"</p>

<p>"These hills, and&mdash;speaking of it."</p>

<p>His brother said nothing, only looked at him in
wonder, as he rose with hands thrust in pockets
and walked the length of the little terrace formed
by the refuse of the mine. The two brothers had
changed places. It was now Keith, the cool, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
indifferent, who had crossed some line of emotional
experience where speech was a relief&mdash;Keith, of all
men! Teddy wondered who the woman could be;
she would be worth seeing.</p>

<p>"So you see, Ted," observed the other, with a
forced laugh, "you need not explain things to me.
When the woman comes, none of us cares much
what the other fellow thinks."</p>

<p>"If she is the right woman, I'm mighty sorry, old
man, that it's going to be as you say&mdash;that you are
not going to see her again."</p>

<p>"Don't waste good sorrow! I'm the only fool in
the case&mdash;she doesn't care."</p>

<p>"That's not so easy to believe," declared Teddy,
loyally. "You probably only asked her once, and
then hit the trail before she could change her mind."</p>

<p>"Ask her. When people care, words are not so
necessary."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, but girls do expect words; though
the right girl&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She doesn't know that she was the right girl; I
may not have made it clear. I was a fool who
dreamed dreams and believed them true. Talking
about it doesn't help. I thought it might; that's all."</p>

<p>He continued to walk the terrace, as though with a
certain impatience at having let go of himself. Teddy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
regarded him for a few moments of awkward silence.
Keith had never been demonstrative, and this sudden
confidence caught Teddy unprepared. He felt ill at
ease, realizing that it was no light sentiment, causing
him to let go of himself and speak.</p>

<p>"I reckon this particular mountain must be bewitched,"
he said at last. "The only other time you
talked of a girl&mdash;any special girl&mdash;was after we were
led across yon range by that girl of the convent.
Even then you talked of her only when the knock on
your head sent you luny. What was the name they
called her? Spirit&mdash;Doña Spirit&mdash;Doña Espiritu!
That is it! I really thought for a few days of your
ravings that we were going to have a nun in the family;
and now it's a new girl!"</p>

<p>Keith regarded him for a moment, then in silence
took out tobacco and made a cigarette. Of what use
were words?</p>

<p>"I always wondered who that girl was and what
became of her," continued Teddy. "The old padre
was as dumb as an oyster on the subject. Did you
learn more than her name?"</p>

<p>"Not much," said Keith, briefly.</p>

<p>"I always meant to. Funny how those crack-brained
Indians let up on the attack that night, when
she slipped that ring on your finger and held up your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
hand for them to see. It was the last thing I noted
before I keeled over. Those Indians have not forgotten
that. They knew when I came back here, and
they seemed to watch either the mine or me,&mdash;I don't
know which it is. Once they asked an old Mexican
for you; he speaks their lingo. They described you
as 'the man of the ring.'"</p>

<p>"That's queer."</p>

<p>"Did the girl tell you what the ring meant?"</p>

<p>"Meant?" repeated Keith, questioningly.</p>

<p>"Yes. To the tribe, it means more than a mere
ring. The old Mexican gathered that much. It had
something the significance of a sceptre, and was worn
only by one of the rulers in the old days. When that
girl put it on your finger, the tribe thought it meant
that she had picked you out for marriage. She didn't
tell you?"</p>

<p>"No, she didn't tell me."</p>

<p>"Well, it's all that saved our lives that night. You
know the old padre is dead. It was he did the sleight-of-hand
work in getting the girl out of sight before
you got on your feet again. With some threat of
eternal flames, he shut the lips of every Mexican I
tried to bribe to find her."</p>

<p>Keith took the cigarette from his lips, and looked
at him without speaking. Teddy smiled and nodded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
"Yes, I looked for her without your knowing it.
You came nearer going 'over the range' in that
fever than you ever realized. The English doctor
down there asked me who the devil 'Espiritu' was,
and said that she could probably do more to lower
your temperature than his drugs. I tried to locate
her, as soon as I could hobble on a crutch, but it was
no use. The padre said she had taken the black veil:
that shut us out."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," assented Keith, absently.</p>

<p>"You never mentioned her name after you got on
your feet, so I figured that it did not really mean
anything. Girls never did mean much to you, individually,
Keith,&mdash;until now."</p>

<p>"Until now."</p>

<p>"And now it's no use, since you can't see her
again."</p>

<p>Keith puffed away in thoughtful silence before
he spoke.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not. Yet&mdash;<i>quien sabe</i>? A sentiment
may be like a sunrise, lifting clouds for you and making
you see things&mdash;things within yourself you never
suspected were there. Our trail in these hills followed
the light of the morning star once, and we got out
of the wilderness to safety: that star has meant
something to me ever since. I can't possess it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
but the meaning of it is mine. I can't give myself
to the right woman,"&mdash;and he held out his hand
and looked at it,&mdash;"but no conventions of the world,
no man-made walls can prevent the thought of me
from going to her&mdash;the thought which, after all,
is the real me. When that is so, who can say that
even an unknown love has not its own uses? It may
prove the illumination of a whole lifetime."</p>

<p>Teddy, with wonder in his eyes, laid his hand on his
brother's shoulder. "Old man, that kind of feeling is
beyond me. I want my girl with me, and I want her
mighty bad. I've lived beside you all my life, and
never dreamed it was in you to care like that for any
woman. It only shows how little we know, after all."</p>

<p>"Yes; how little, after all, until the right woman
crosses the trail."</p>

<p>"The chances are that we can never talk of it again.
I know you <i>that</i> much! I told you this old hill
of the temple was uncanny&mdash;bewitched,&mdash;and it is.
You never would have mentioned this to me in
civilized places."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," agreed Keith. "And you're
right&mdash;I could never speak of it again."</p>

<p>They never did. That night they talked only
of Teddy's enterprise, and covered much paper with
many figures, and made fine plans for the future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
The next day it was that Keith, hunting in the
hills, heard an unusual blast from the mine, felt
the ground tremble from the shock, and turning
back on the trail, met a Mexican with a bleeding
hand and a cut face, who urged him to hasten. It
was the word of the padre!</p>

<p>He reached Teddy's side only in time to accept
"Angela&mdash;poor little Angela&mdash;" as a life-long
legacy. There had been an explosion. Graves were
made for the young engineer and three of his Mexican
miners on the side of the mountain. When
it was all over, Keith Bryton climbed to the heights
above, where the broken walls of stone showed white
and gray among forest growth on the temple terrace.
Below, and beyond the ranges, lay the world. In
his isolation of grief, he felt as alone as the solitary
mountain rising from the plain below, through which
a river ran. Far down the river, miles away, gleamed
a cross on the chapel of a convent. It was the old
Mexican pueblo of which he had told Alvara. He
remembered saying to the old man that he would
never come back; yet here he was. How useless
to say what one will or will not do in this world!
One must make allowance for the moves fate insists
upon in the game of life.</p>

<p>Back of him, on a slight elevation, stood some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
broken columns, and half an arch yet showed where
an entrance had been, and under a dwarfed and
twisted oak half covered with tropical vines a bench
of marble gleamed. Two birds fluttered to the
ground near him and turned inquisitive eyes on the
intruder. He watched them carelessly, until one of
them perched on a fallen block of stone ornamented
with the sculptured sun of the Aztecs. It brought
back like a flash that other day when he went from
the presence of death to a ruined altar-place, where
the Aztec sun and the cactus commemorated some
unknown Mexican sculptor who cut the symbol
of the faith of his people into the walls of a Christian
church.</p>

<p>He closed his eyes, and the vision of that other day
was only intensified. The wind in the oaks back of
him sounded like the surf on San Juan's beach; and
through it the slow, fateful words of a girl kneeling
in her wedding-veil echoed in his ears as it had done
a thousand times:</p>

<p>"So long&mdash;as&mdash;we&mdash;both&mdash;shall live!"</p>

<p>There were no weeping girls here, and no bells
to toll out the death message; but otherwise the
atmosphere of the place, and the illusion, were
perfect. How&mdash;how had he chanced to enter into
this half-pagan atmosphere of death? Unconsciously,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
automatically, he turned and re-turned on his finger
the onyx ring at which Angela had laughed.</p>

<p>He was still seated there when the miners who had
filled the graves came up the path, and with them
the priest from the plains below. The Mexicans
halted outside the broken walls. Only one Indian,
who had followed at a distance, crossed the line of
entrance, and stood apart, watching and listening
in a furtive way&mdash;watching the American especially.</p>

<p>"Many times I have heard of this place," said the
priest, "but never before have I been so far into the
mountain. There are strange old traditions of it in
the accounts some of the early padres left. Their
king or chief became Christian and gave his sons to
the Church, but the main body of the people kept to
many of their pagan rites. And this was their temple.
The men ask me if you continue with the mining,
señor."</p>

<p>He noticed they all listened for the answer, and
looked relieved when he said, "No."</p>

<p>"They are all very glad, señor. They ask me to
tell you they have no ill will, but they say not any of
their men will go into the mine of the temple."</p>

<p>"Some superstition?"</p>

<p>"It seems so. They say one man always dies
when outsiders meddle with the mountain, but never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
before have three men died at once. They ask you
to let the company know that none of them will
come back."</p>

<p>"Very good," and Bryton arose and picked up the
sombrero he had dropped beside him. "I will tell
them to bring foreigners if they mean to keep on; but
I doubt it. The cave-in down there means a fortune
to dig out. I don't think they have the capital."</p>

<p>He was turning away, when he noticed the Indian.</p>

<p>"Is he a workman?"</p>

<p>The others exchanged glances, and then one of
them stepped forward.</p>

<p>"No, señor. He is one of the mountain people.
No one knows where they live. I know a little of
their talk. He says for us all to go away, or worse
things will always happen. He&mdash;he wants to speak
to you."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>The man hesitated, and then said a few words,
and the Indian replied in a strange jargon with peculiar
aspirated syllables.</p>

<p>"He says," continued the interpreter, hesitatingly,
"to ask if she is to come back."</p>

<p>"She?"</p>

<p>Bryton's face flushed, as the priest looked at him
curiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
"You have known those people before?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;my brother and I were lost once in the forest
here. We&mdash;well, we were made to feel we had trespassed;
but some one&mdash;a sort of missionary among
them&mdash;made them lead us to the plain. It would have
been better if my brother had never come back."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;?"</p>

<p>The priest noticed Bryton's hesitation; so did the
Indian, for he walked direct to him, and pointed
to the ring he wore, and looked from the ring to
Bryton's face.</p>

<p>"Tell him," said the American, "that she is a
man's wife, and lives in a lovely land."</p>

<p>"You see her&mdash;some day?" asked the Indian.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not ever again&mdash;perhaps."</p>

<p>The Indian bent his head, and with a slight
gesture as of farewell, turned and walked swiftly
away from them, around the bend of the mountain.</p>

<p>"Your words have an unusual interest," said the
priest, as they walked down toward the plain. "They
suggest that the missionary might be the one they
spoke of here as the Indian nun."</p>

<p>"This lady was not Indian," said Keith, decidedly.
"Her skin was whiter than either yours or mine.
The Indians called her Doña Espiritu! It was the
only name they knew her by."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
"It was the same, and her father's name was
Estevan," said the priest, quietly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know now. His name was Estevan, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And he was the man who died the awful death
up there." And he pointed back to the temple.</p>

<p>"No!" Bryton stopped on the path and faced
the priest, thus halting the entire procession at a
point where a yawning gulf of a cañon reached to
unseen depths below.</p>

<p>"For the love of Christ&mdash;señor!" screamed the
priest, while the Mexicans in the rear clung to their
burros and swore.</p>

<p>"The man who was killed left no child," persisted
Bryton. "I heard the story."</p>

<p>"A daughter was born six months after his death&mdash;after
the wife had taken the black veil of eternal
renunciation of the world," declared the priest,
solemnly. "Now, señor, for the love of God, will
you let us find safer footing?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Pardon me!" and Bryton continued
thoughtfully along the trail to the plain below.
When they reached a broader road where it was
possible to ride abreast, he asked one more question.</p>

<p>"Father, does she know?"</p>

<p>"Not unless some in the world have told her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Here, the old priest, her uncle, had power enough
over the wild tribe to make them promise they
would not tell her until she had lived twenty years.
He died ten years ago, but they kept faith. There
are some people in the world who had to know,&mdash;the
lawyers and judges who settled the estate,&mdash;for
Estevan was a man of wealth. He carried wounds
here from the war for California. The child thought
he died from the effects of those. Out in the world
where she has gone, that wild barbaric outbreak of her
mother's people will never be known; and of the few
who have learned it who would tell her?"</p>

<p>"True, father: who would?"</p>

<p>He did not go north for a month.
His letter to Angela contained
a check, which she at once
invested in very becoming
mourning, for which she of
course had to journey to Los
Angeles.</p>

<p>With her went Don Eduardo Downing and his
wife, Doña Maria, who, with Rafael, had unpleasant
business to transact with the bishop, and were irritable
in consequence. Bryton called upon them at the
home of the ex-Governor of California. After
Angela's first emotional outburst at the details of
Teddy's death and burial,&mdash;and regret that a Protestant
clergyman was not to be had,&mdash;she managed to
come back to subjects nearer home, and retail a few
of the changes since the death of Doña Luisa.</p>

<p>There had not been time for many. Yet&mdash;well&mdash;there
had been the marriage, of course; and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
relations who thought it so fine a thing that Rafael
married an heiress and a saint were not so sure now.
The tone of Angela and her slight shrug of contempt
showed that she shared their doubts.</p>

<p>Raquel Estevan de Arteaga was in the city. She
had ridden the sixty miles on horseback, and all the
old Spanish families were entertaining her in a style
magnificent as their means would allow; but all who
cared to have her must invite no heretic Americans,
and it was understood to be a promise to Doña Luisa.
She did not wish to meet the English-speaking people;
not one had yet crossed her threshold; even
Don Eduardo, sharing some business interests with
her husband, was not welcomed, because he held fields
of the old Mission, for which the Church was fighting
in the courts of law.</p>

<p>The bishop himself had set the pace for courtesy
toward Raquel. He had called on her personally, had
a long private interview (Angela's opinion of clerical
private interviews with young wives was expressed by
another shrug), and he made a point of calling on
several families where she visited.</p>

<p>Doña Maria was of course justly offended. Her
estates had been greater than those of the Arteagas,
and her family name was older in the land than Estevan,
which after all was only Spanish for Stevens.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
On this subject it was easy to see Angela agreed
perfectly with the wife of her cousin. Each had
built her own plan for certain social supremacies in
the little kingdom of San Juan, but neither had
reckoned with the fact that the girl from a convent
in Mexico would assume a rule there such as no one
else had ever dared attempt, and emphasize it by
barring out heretics, even when married into Catholic
families.</p>

<p>What Rafael thought of it no one yet knew. He
hated the old Mission, above all places. The only
time it was worth while was when the dances were
held in the old dining-room; and when his mother
died he thought of course no woman would ever wish
to live there. A town residence was assured, and thus
closer connection with the new, progressive people.
But the bride of a day had decided differently: when
a home befitting their station was built for her in San
Juan, she would move to it; until then the Mission
rooms would serve, and they must arrange it with the
bishop.</p>

<p>To tell her that the bishop no longer had jurisdiction
over the property was of no use whatever. She
had listened quietly to the legal details of the auction
sale, when it had all been bought by Eduardo Downing
and Miguel Arteaga.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
"That is right, to buy it when the place was sold
for debt; any son of the Church should do that," she
conceded; "but to hold it,&mdash;to treat it as a quarry
from which to mine bricks and blocks of stone,&mdash;may
the saints intercede for your brother in his grave, who
did such wickedness! If your mother had known that
a son of hers was fighting in the courts of law against
the Church, it would have killed her the day the word
reached her. If you people value money more than
the blessing of God, I will give you money for it&mdash;to
you and your English partner; but not another
blast of powder must shatter the place of the altar."</p>

<p>It was in vain they told her Doña Maria had a
pious plan to blow down the stonework&mdash;the most
magnificent monument of such Indian labor ever
erected in that part of Mexico which is now United
States,&mdash;and to build on its site an adobe chapel of
her own design. Raquel Estevan de Arteaga listened
quietly to all the plans, but shook her head.</p>

<p>"It is sacrilege; it shall not be," she repeated.
"Since gold is the god of the English people, we
will give them gold."</p>

<p>"But you forget, beloved," put in Rafael. "Doña
Maria is Catholic&mdash;is Spanish&mdash;is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Rafael," said his bride, quietly, "will you listen a
little? Then it will be no need to speak of those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
things again&mdash;we will both understand. The padre
comes a stranger to San Juan as I do, but he comes
from a strange land, and cares not anything for these
different races. But I have all the names of those
people from your mother, that I know whom to avoid
in this life&mdash;and in the next."</p>

<p>"My mother was one of the old Spanish people;
they were slow. Times change."</p>

<p>"Yes, times did change when men like Alvarado
were pushed aside and a quadroon ruled the politics
and the Mission property. Thus California paved
the way for American rule. In politics and business
men must meet unpleasant people often, but it is not
ever necessary for the ladies of any family to do so;
and, Rafael, here before your padre, two things I must
say. The heretics I have promised never to meet
except as God sends them in our path. As for the
Spanish ladies you mention, if you do not know that
there is not a woman of noble Spanish blood in the
length of this valley, then you shut your eyes very
tight when you might see. The daughters of Don
Juan Alvara have one Spanish strain in them;
the others are mixed people of Mexican, Indian,
and negro, and few of them care to remember their
grandmothers. When you bring into my house
Spanish ladies of good breeding, I shall be glad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
to make them welcome, but I do not care for the
substitutes. The Indios by the river are of more
interest, for they need to be taught."</p>

<p>This conversation had been repeated by Padre
Andros to Doña Maria over a game of <i>malilla</i> and a
glass of the new American drink called whiskey,&mdash;a
gift from the army officers, and enjoyed very
much by the ladies of San Juan; it suggested a drink
made of chilis, because of the appetizing burn it
gave the throat.</p>

<p>Padre Andros was frightened when he saw the
effect of his recital. Doña Maria was not so stout as
most of the women of the mixed races; but as he saw
the dark color mount luridly to her face, and her eyes
look almost bloodshot with sudden fury, he set down
the glass of whiskey to cross himself, and dropped an
ace in his perturbation.</p>

<p>"For the love of God! señora," he exclaimed; and
then it was Angela entered the room and found
her cousin's wife ill with a fury she durst express
only in prayers and maledictions against this girl
brought to San Juan by Doña Luisa to ruin them all!</p>

<p>Only fragments of the cause of her fury reached
Angela, despite all her sudden sympathetic interest
in the wife of her cousin, to whom she had heretofore
been rather indifferent. But she pieced the fragments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
together, and as she told them to Bryton he could,
with his own knowledge of the early racial mixtures
in the land, get a very fair idea of the situation.
The girl from Mexico had dared open the closet
of a forgotten skeleton.</p>

<p>"Of course she rules Rafael just now, to a certain
extent," conceded Angela, carelessly. "He sees the
Church and half the town at her feet here; she is
a novelty, and he sees everyone turn to look at her.
But at San Juan she will find no one at her feet,
and her churchmen will be far enough away. The
padre there detests her; she stopped him from selling
bricks from the cloister pillars."</p>

<p>"The padre and Doña Maria should make a
strong team," observed Bryton. "The woman need
be strong to win against them&mdash;is she?"</p>

<p>"How do I know? I've never spoken to her. She
has nasty eyes. That's all I can remember of her."</p>

<p>"Nasty?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it is the expression. I saw them once, and
she made me nervous. Perhaps it was because she
divined that I was one of the 'accursed heretics.'
I understand that is the way the lower order speak
of Protestants!"</p>

<p>"But she cannot be quite of the lower order,
can she? Her father was of the best Spanish and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
American blood ever joined on this coast, far above
the Arteagas."</p>

<p>"Oh! So you also look up pedigrees here; I
wonder why."</p>

<p>"It is a country where you hear of them without
question," he returned, indifferently. "The people
are always sparring among themselves and referring
to their ancestors&mdash;if they dare. Doña Luisa was a
pure-blood Spanish woman, but the Arteagas had a
bad Indian and Mexican streak. She saw it develop
in her own children, and it gave her a bad fright.
She counted on this marriage bringing the last of
them back to the old conservative manner of life."</p>

<p>"Ah!" She shrugged her shoulders contemptuously;
"but you forget that Raquel, the present
Señora Arteaga, has also a Mexican streak."</p>

<p>"No, I don't forget; but there are high class and
low of every race. Noble Indians and high-class
Mexicans have gone into history. The American
makes a great mistake when he judges the high
classes by the masses. In this land one has to dig
out the facts of each individual line, if he wants to
know the truth of a pedigree. But the lady from
Mexico seems to have drawn her distinctions very
closely, and realizing her own superiority, she dares
dictate."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
"Even to her&mdash;husband?" There was just the
slightest possible hesitation at the title.</p>

<p>"Why not, if she is the superior?"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;oh, can't you see how all these marriages
are a barter-and-sale family affair,&mdash;money that is
married, instead of people? If she was in love with
him as a&mdash;a real woman would be, she never would
know she was superior, never! Not that I believe
she is," she added with a shrug; "to me she looks
as wooden as the saints on her own altar."</p>

<p>He arose and walked to the window, staring out
over the heads of the people.</p>

<p>"She may not be wooden to those she cares
for," he said at last.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not; but I'm certain of one thing: if
she ever cared for any one, it is not the man she
married. If she cared, she would forget that rigid
fanatic sense of duty sometimes."</p>

<p>"I came to talk of your affairs," he said, abruptly.
"Teddy left some mining shares; they may pan out
later on. I have talked with a lawyer about them;
this is his address," and he handed her a slip of paper.
"Whatever funds are procurable he will turn over to
you quarterly. Is there anything else I can do for
you at present?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she returned; "you might be a bit human
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
and sympathetic. You seem to forget," and her red
lip quivered in self-pity, "how utterly alone I am
among these Mexicans, and all their women jealous
as fiends."</p>

<p>He regarded her with a long, steady stare, and then
smiled as he rose.</p>

<p>"I don't blame them," he observed, quietly. "You
have given more attention to several of their men
than you ever gave to poor Ted. Where's your
baby?"</p>

<p>"Heavens! Do you suppose I could drag her
on this trip, and a Mexican or Indian nurse?" she
demanded, impatiently. "That's so like a man!
They think a woman with a child should be merely
a domestic animal, like those dunces of Spanish
women. I feel as if I were in jail, hedged around
with all their conventions. I don't dare walk on
the street alone, or with a man; I don't dare ride in
a carriage with a man, and it's no pleasure to go with
those empty-headed women. Doña Maria is as bad
as the rest since I'm in mourning; it is a sort of
prison, forbidding the wearer a free breath!"</p>

<p>"Take it off," he suggested, so quietly that he
quite deceived her, and she uttered a little cry of
shocked appeal.</p>

<p>"Keith! And poor Teddy&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
"Angela!" and his hand fell heavy on her shoulder,
"listen to me just once. When Ted was alive I
could bear to hear you mention his name, but now
that he is dead I&mdash;can't. He belongs to me now,
and I forbid it."</p>

<p>"Keith!" She gasped again, but this time in
sheer fright. "And the money&mdash;the shares you&mdash;"</p>

<p>He laughed mirthlessly, and took his hand from
her shoulder. His moment of feeling gave place
to amused appreciation of the real woman poor Ted
had never known.</p>

<p>"Who says women are inconsistent?" he queried.
"You are a living illustration of the contrary. I
have never seen you vary a hair's-breadth from my
first instinctive feeling concerning you, you pretty
baby kitten! You needn't look so frightened; you
will get whatever money is in reach. Now, don't go
to whimpering! Get on your bonnet, if Doña Maria
may think it allowable for me to take you both for
a carriage drive. I promised Ted to do things for
you, and I must make a beginning."</p>

<p>"Is that the only reason?" she began, with righteous
indignation.</p>

<p>"That is the only reason, my lady," he returned.
"Are you coming?"</p>

<p>A little later they were rolling along Spring Street,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
past the plaza, and many heads turned to look at the
golden-haired girlish little figure in mourning, drooping
beside Doña Maria, whose rigid, unsmiling, dark
features were the best possible foil. Keith Bryton,
sitting opposite, noticed the admiration she aroused.
The caballeros who had swept sombreros to the ground
at the passage of the carriage in which Raquel and
the bishop were riding did so as a matter of reverence
to a devotee; but the rule of the woman whom Keith
had called a baby kitten would always be one of childish
appeal, personal to a degree.</p>

<p>Looking at her cynically, he tried to fancy her
twenty years ahead,&mdash;the mother of a grown daughter,&mdash;but
failed. The daughter would have to be
guardian; the mother would always need one. She
was watching him furtively to see the effect this open
admiration might have upon him. He was the
one man of them all who had ever dared treat her
so carelessly. His attitude had piqued her to the
point where she had a brief tigerish desire to rend
his heart&mdash;his affections&mdash;if he had any! And
Teddy was the weapon.</p>

<p>Of course she had regretted it all&mdash;there were
other men with so much more money. Still,
as it had turned out, it was not so bad. She was
installed as a member of his family, and that was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
better than to depend entirely on the cousinship to the
Mexican Doña Maria. She was really a little afraid
of the swarthy black-browed women of the country.
To be sure, they sat around in fat content, with their
bits of embroidery or drawn work, and seemed to see
nothing else; but she had seen Doña Maria whip an
Indian servant with her own hands one day, and the
blind rage in the dark face had ever after made Angela
a trifle more respectful. It was not nice to be entirely
at the mercy of ignorant power. Don Eduardo was
always ready with gold pieces for a pretty woman, but
even the distant cousinhood might not be all the
protection required for a lady of Angela's beauty, if
any animosity should ever take root in Doña Maria's
mind.</p>

<p>So it was all well as things stood. Keith Bryton
would, she knew, keep to both letter and spirit of any
promise he had made poor Teddy, and she felt sure
the fond boy had exacted much of the brother who
he thought could accomplish all things.</p>

<p>Thus she decided, as she watched and weighed his
apparent amused indifference to the admiration she
excited. Fair women were at a premium in the City
of the Angels. He had just arrived from the dusky
tribes of Mexico; before that he had ranged the
desert land; but she realized with resentment that no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
beauty of hers would ever make an oasis for him.
The men who did admire her he regarded as fools.</p>

<p>He saw her glance from him, and she set her white
teeth together with a little click of absolute frustration.
She had accepted his ungracious invitation in order to
show him the admiration her mere appearance on the
drive would excite, and it all weighed not an iota.
Would he ever really care for any one? Had he ever
cared?</p>

<p>Then he moved his hand, and the sun gleamed on the
ring he wore, the Mexican onyx with the Aztec eagle.
It recalled the adventure over which she had laughed
at the Mission. She had never believed Teddy when
he declared that Keith's attraction for that queer
Mexican nun was a serious fact. Teddy knew so
little, so very little, of the real feelings of either men
or women. He had gone to his death buoyed for
any sort of adventure by the absolute conviction that
his wife adored him. Poor Teddy! Never would
any woman be able to fool Keith Bryton like that,&mdash;not
even the woman he would care for, if she ever did
appear.</p>

<p>While she thought so, and watched him, his face
grew suddenly rigid and colorless. The carriage of
the bishop came down the street, the palomentos with
their golden coats and silver manes and tails shining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
like satin in the sunlight. Rafael sat with his back to
the horses, looking very much bored indeed, but
beside the bishop sat the woman who had faced her
on the hill of San Juan, and who had held her horse
in the middle of the road.</p>

<p>She was prepared for the sudden light of appreciation
in Rafael's beautiful eyes, as he lifted his hat and
let his glance linger and meet hers for one swift instant
of comprehension, but she was not prepared for the
sudden leaning forward of his dark-browed bride, and
the quick look with which she took in the two women
in the carriage, and then the colorless face of their
escort.</p>

<p>He looked at her levelly as he lifted his hat in
acknowledgment of her husband's salutation. If his
glance held ever so slight a suggestion of warning, it
was unheeded by her. Her dark eyes glowed, her
red lips parted and lost their color as she rested one
slender jewelled hand on the carriage frame, and stared
at him with incredulous eyes; one could see that she
did not even breathe as the carriages whirled past each
other; at least Angela noted it.</p>

<p>By turning her head she saw Rafael put out his
hand suddenly to his wife, who had sunk back on the
cushions beside the bishop. His manner suggested
that he thought her ill. Keith could see the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
without turning his head. But even after he observed
the lace-draped shoulders straighten themselves, and
the head held again proudly erect under the mantilla,
he continued to gaze after them, unconscious that the
blue eyes opposite him were alive with curiosity.</p>

<p>"One would think you were a long-lost brother,
from the way that woman stared," she remarked.
"One would think she would show more restraint
when riding in state beside the bishop, and with her
husband opposite."</p>

<p>Keith recovered himself and turned his attention
to her.</p>

<p>"Was that Rafael Arteaga's wife?" he asked, carelessly.
"I supposed it was, but have not had the
honor of being presented."</p>

<p>"Well, they told me she would not notice heretics,
but one heretic was the only person she noticed in this
carriage. How she looked at you! I told you she
had nasty staring eyes, like augers boring through one.
Did you see, Doña Maria? Did you not fear she
would disgrace us all by leaping into the carriage?"</p>

<p>Doña Maria's black, bead-like eyes were regarding
the young man curiously.</p>

<p>"It may be a custom of Mexico for ladies to show
attention to strange men in that way," she observed,
guardedly. "It may be so. I had never heard of it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
The new lady of the Mission is teaching San Juan
many new things, but I do not think she will teach it
that sort of manners. They do not compare well with
the American ladies' manners&mdash;no?"</p>

<p>"I fancy it was only as your escort she was gracious
enough to turn and look at me; she might have fancied
I was known to her. She looks very young."</p>

<p>"You would forget she was young if you heard her
talk to the padre," returned Doña Maria, significantly.
"It was enough to bring a malediction on all our heads
to listen to it!"</p>

<p>"The bishop has forgiven her; at least it looks so."</p>

<p>"Oh, she is clever! He thinks she is a saint, this
bishop. But the padre knows!"</p>

<p>She did not add, "and I know," but her thin cold
lips with their satisfied smile suggested as much, and
Bryton, observing it, felt anew that the girl from
Mexico had a strong team to fight in Doña Maria and
the padre.</p>

<p>When the night was old, and
others slept, Raquel Arteaga
crept in silence to the bedside
of the old Indian woman of the
hill tribe who had been her
nurse, who was still her maid,
and who was the one link she
kept near her of the old life.</p>

<p>"Tia Polonia, awake!" she said, briefly; and as the
woman did so, frightened and full of questions, her
mistress held up her hand and rested herself on the
side of the pallet, regarding the dark old face with
doubt.</p>

<p>"Thy husband, beloved,&mdash;he has&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is not my husband this time, Polonia. He is
quite safe at the gaming-table, and will come in at
sunrise with empty pockets. It is not my husband.
It is&mdash;" She paused a long time, scrutinizing every
feature of the old woman, who grew gray of visage
under those smouldering eyes, and her hands shook.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
"Darling, little one, thou art so like thy mother;
more than ever when angry, and it is night; and I&mdash;Holy
God! It is like a ghost comes to my bed to&mdash;to&mdash;ah,
Doña Espiritu&mdash;mia!&mdash;what is the anger in thine
eyes?"</p>

<p>"Can a dead woman be angry?" demanded her
mistress drearily, the beautiful curved mouth quivering
for an instant. "And it is a dead woman they
have made of me&mdash;all of you! You lied to me,
Polonia, when you brought word to me he had died
there in Mexico!"</p>

<p>The old woman covered her face with her hands,
and sank back whimpering on the pallet.</p>

<p>"I trusted you, and you lied to me, all of you!"
the girl repeated in a hopeless tone of finality. "All
these months he has been alive, and I have not
known. You liars&mdash;liars&mdash;liars accursed!"</p>

<p>The old woman uttered a smothered shriek, and
buried her face in the blankets.</p>

<p>"Not the curse, beloved, not the curse!" she
begged, tremulously, "the curse of your people. It
means&mdash;it means&mdash;Ai! not the curse, little one!
Thou hast only meant to frighten me to tell you
how it was, and I will&mdash;I will! Only, child of the
spirits, Doña Espiritu, bring not the curse!"</p>

	title='You Lied to me&mdash;All of You!' alt='Doña Angela' />
</a>
<p>&ldquo;You Lied to me&mdash;All of You!&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>She cowered and mumbled in a sort of palsied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
fear, but the girl sat there untouched by her misery,
looking at her drearily. Perhaps she had some slight
hope of denial, but Polonia's gray face put that out
of her reach.</p>

<p>"Sit up," she commanded, and the old woman
hastily scrambled into a sitting posture, but with
her hands over her eyes, her body still rocking with
fear. "Why did you do it?"</p>

<p>Never before had Tia Polonia heard those hard
cold tones from her "querida"&mdash;her little one&mdash;her
nursling of other days. This girl sitting there erect
in the glimmering light of the candle was really Doña
Espiritu of the tribe of the kings.</p>

<p>"Excellencia," she muttered, "it is true; I did sin.
But the padre gave me the word. He said your soul
was lost; that the man had bewitched you as&mdash;as your
little mother had been bewitched when she&mdash;when she
left religion for your father, and in the end they both
died&mdash;and so soon!&mdash;and&mdash;and I wanted you to
live, Excellencia! and I wanted your soul to live; and&mdash;so
it was I took the word of the padre to you, and
told you he was dead&mdash;and wished that he was dead&mdash;but
it was all no use at all! On his hand when the
fever burned was your ring&mdash;it kept him alive and
he could not die, and all day and all night he said,
'Doña Espiritu! Doña Espiritu!' The padre heard,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
and I heard. The American brother, he heard too,
and asked the Indios who was Doña Espiritu, and
where did she live, that he might send for her. But
it was no use. The padre made them all afraid for
your soul, so that I told you the lie. Now it is all
said, and my life is going out of my body at the curse
of your anger."</p>

<p>In fact, the fear in the old creature had worked on
her own nerves, so that her final words were very
faint. She spoke as one half swooning, and put out
her hand in pitiful plea for help.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;the good padre," said the girl, bitterly.
"Well, you see how it has all ended. The padre
died, and has gone to God to answer for the lie; and
the man he wished dead is alive&mdash;alive&mdash;alive, and
oh&mdash;Mother of God! is happy with&mdash;with&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her cold self-control melted in a flood of tears,
and she flung herself face down on the pallet beside
the frightened Indian woman, her form shaken with
shuddering sobs of absolute despair.</p>

<p>The dawn was near. All the night she had walked
in her room alone, stunned and wordless over this
thing she could not fight, or reason, or pray away;
and now, having heard it all,&mdash;even of his calls for
her when unconscious,&mdash;she had let fall for the first
time the cold mask she had worn since the death
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
of Doña Luisa, and since the significance of her vow
had been revealed to her by the days and nights of
Rafael's life.</p>

<p>She wept in a wild abandonment of grief at the
hopeless vista of years reaching on to the edge of the
world where death is. It had all been dreary enough
before; but now&mdash;</p>

<p>When the birds began their welcome of the day
she was still lying prone, but silent. The tempest
of feeling had passed, and her Indian woman stroked
her hair softly, and waited, and did not speak. At
last she rose, and looked out on the yellowing light
touching the purple of the mountains.</p>

<p>"This is only a dream of the night, Polonia," she
said, with a great sigh; "sleep again, and forget it all."</p>

<p>But the old woman clung with trembling hands to
the folds of the girl's gown, and rested her cheek on
the silken slippers.</p>

<p>"And the curse, darling? what of the curse of the
lie?"</p>

<p>"Curses come home to the people who utter them,"
said the girl, drearily. "On my head they all lie&mdash;the
curse by which I was made blind for a little, little
while of life, and which now allows me to see when
it is too late. The curse of God has followed our
people; no blessing of the Church can wipe it out."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
"But I&mdash;I&mdash;beloved?"</p>

<p>"The sin that is for love is not so black a sin, and
it was your love the padre trusted to&mdash;your fear
that I was bewitched and lost. But it is all over;
we are in a new land, and this is a new life."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;he is happy&mdash;without thee?"</p>

<p>"I have seen his wife; people call her beautiful. I
saw him almost touching her, yet I did not scream."</p>

<p>"Mother of God! his wife!"</p>

<p>"I heard her name,&mdash;it was enough. His I did not
need to ask; I remembered."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;dear one&mdash;it is better that he is married.
Pardon, beloved&mdash;I am at thy feet, and I feel thy
heartache. But, after all, is it not to thank the
saints that he is married?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps. Otherwise, he might say to me some
day, 'Come!' And the witchcraft of the ring might
hold, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Holy Mother! and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I&mdash;God knows what I might do, Polonia."</p>

<p>And then the old Indian woman was left alone,
mumbling prayers and crossing herself.</p>

<p>Later she got up and went to the priest of Our
Lady of the Angels and brought a bottle of holy
water to sprinkle on the threshold of the street door,
and all sides of Doña Raquel's room, that no curse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
of witchcraft or bad dream of the night might have
power over the days.</p>

<p>It was broad daylight when Rafael came home
whistling gayly a dance of melody. He had been
gifted with unusual good luck, and his pockets were
full of gold pieces. He threw a buckskin sack of
coin on his wife's bed before he noticed that she was
not lying there.</p>

<p>"Hola! Raquelita mia! There is plenty to pay
for masses; your priests always want money for that
sort of thing. Since you look after my soul, I pay
for the prayers when I have good luck."</p>

<p>Raquel arose from where she knelt at the little
altar in the corner.</p>

<p>"Oh, is that where you are? What need to pay
the priests when you do enough praying for an
army?"</p>

<p>She smiled absently, but did not speak. He stood
watching her as she brushed her mass of dark, slightly
waving hair.</p>

<p>"Let your woman do that," he said at last, with
perfunctory solicitude. "It tires your arm, and I
don't want you tired to-day. There is a picnic, and
we should go."</p>

<p>"Which of our friends make it?"</p>

<p>"It is Doña Maria Downing, who, as our one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
neighbor down the country, wants to add to the
entertainment Los Angeles gives you. It is to make
peace with the bishop, I think; at least, so it looks.
He is invited. You can help them to be friends. Is
that not the duty of us both as good Catholics?"</p>

<p>She halted in her task and looked at him quietly.
He was plainly set on being very agreeable, for some
reason; too seldom had he mentioned their faith but
to scoff at the rigid rules of his mother and his wife.</p>

<p>"You want it very much," she said; "but why?
You do not care at all for Doña Maria's personal
peace with the bishop. That can be arranged without
a picnic to the hills. It only needs that they give
back, of their own free will, that which belongs to the
Church, and make a confession that it was wrongly
held."</p>

<p>"If you would only talk to her of this graciously,
instead of demanding it," persisted Rafael, gently,
"much could be effected. Doña Angela thinks for
certain&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Doña Angela?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I mean her&mdash;the relative who is with her
now&mdash;the Mrs. Bryton who drove with her yesterday.
The bishop asked who she was&mdash;you remember?"</p>

<p>"I remember," she said, quietly, though a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
shudder touched her. "But I am tired of this town,
Rafael. I meant to tell you so this morning. I want
to ride home to-day. Doña Maria's merry-makings
do not attract me. Our business here is over; let
us go."</p>

<p>"Holy God! but you are a wife for a man!" he
cried in sudden fury. "I weigh you down with jewels
and silks and laces, and you would bury them all
with yourself in that old rat-hole of a Mission. I
wish to God the padre and Doña Maria had blown
down every brick of it before you saw the accursed
place!"</p>

<p>"Accursed? The Church of God? Rafael!"</p>

<p>"Ay, accursed, since you will know!" he repeated.
"Every old Indian of San Juan can tell you that."</p>

<p>"Some Indian, perhaps, who has had to be whipped
by the padres," she remarked, with quiet scorn.</p>

<p>"You don't believe me?" he cried. "Well, you
shall! Sit down&mdash;sit down and listen for once, and
you will be glad to keep out of the curse-haunted
place."</p>

<p>She regarded him with a little tolerant smile, and
drew a serape of blue around her, and curled herself
on the foot of the bed and waited.</p>

<p>"It is early for stories," she observed; "but since
it is your pleasure&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
"Not any pleasure has any of it been to me from
first to last," he retorted, "nor any pleasure will it be
to whoever holds it! You think you are strong, your
saints will help you! But no saint ever put on an
altar&mdash;not even that of the Virgin herself&mdash;can take
off the curse from San Juan till the altar is bathed in
human blood, as the tiles of the floor have been
bathed&mdash;that is the curse of Sahirit."</p>

<p>She stared at him with wide eyes and blanching
face.</p>

<p>"Until the altar is bathed in human blood, as the
tiles of the floor have been," she whispered. "Rafael!
That&mdash;that is of a religion older than the life
of Christianity in Mexico. God of Gods! Does it
follow me here?"</p>

<p>"Follow <i>you</i>!" and he laughed contemptuously;
"it is a story older than our grandfathers. Only the
old Indians whisper it now each time ill luck comes
to any of us&mdash;and I've had enough! When they
picked up Miguel tramped into the earth by the
cattle, only the white men would help&mdash;no Indian;
they knew it was the curse coming true."</p>

<p>"Tell me," she said, briefly. Her lips were white,
and she shuddered with cold, and drew the serape
close.</p>

<p>"You'd rather hear some old Indian tell it," he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
answered; "they make one chill when they count on
their fingers and toes the things the curse has brought.
We had a curse of our own in the Arteaga family:
my mother was always in prayer because of that; she
never knew that Miguel had bought an interest in
another."</p>

<p>"Go on&mdash;tell me! How comes the rule of the
Aztec altar to this Christian temple?"</p>

<p>"Aztec? I did not say Aztec. I know nothing
of their mummeries. But it can't be that&mdash;there
have been no Aztecs since the time of Cortez and
the priests."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I have heard there is one hill tribe still refusing
the saints, and giving the sun worship," she said,
slowly. "But go on; tell me!"</p>

<p>"Sun-worship! yes, that's the thing!" he cried.
"A man, who was a heretic of Mexico and a great
builder of stone, killed a priest and a woman down
there. Some say the woman was his wife. He was
to have his head cut off for it, but word went down
from here that such a man was needed by the priests
of San Juan; they wished to build a stone church
instead of adobe brick, as all the others were, if only a
master mason could be sent to them. They had
soldiers to guard him, even if the man chanced to be
a convict, as many of the guards had been, and they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
got the viceroy to help; and in the end the heretic
who had killed a priest was sent to San Juan. The
old Indios say he looked as big as two men, and he
worked as he pleased. When the padres interfered
he sat down and looked at the piles of stone and
did nothing, and nothing could move him. They
could have shot and buried him, but that would not
build their church, which was to be the finest in the
Californias. So they had to let him alone, and he
built it as pleased himself. Their ground plan only
he accepted. It was like a cross, as you see it now,
but on no other part of the church was any symbol
of Christianity&mdash;only stars and other things which
some say are flowers and some say are suns and
moons, and on the corner-stone and key-stone of the
high altar is carved a thing no Christian can read, not
even the padres&mdash;and somewhere in those symbols is
held the curse."</p>

<p>&ldquo;R&#361;elas me fecit.</p><p>Me Llama San Juan. 1796.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>"Who says? Did he?"</p>

<p>"He? No; he died laughing, and refused the
blessing of the priest. One thing only he said when
he read the words on the oldest bell, as he built a
place in the tower for it. The name of the maker is
on the bell; you can see it yet; it is Ruelas. 'So
Ruelas made you&mdash;iron-tongue,' a soldier heard him
say, 'and your name is San Juan. Well, Señor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Ruelas, you only have your name in this work. The
good padres will see that my name is forgotten, but
instead of a name, I will leave myself, and so long as
stone stands on stone I will call louder and farther
than your iron tongue when rung your loudest!
When the storms of centuries shall beat out every
star and moon and sun in the stone of the temple,
the man from Culiacan will be remembered here in
Sahirit.'"</p>

<p>"Sahirit?"</p>

<p>"The Indian name for the valley was 'Quanis Savit
Sahirit'; you can see it on the church records."</p>

<p>"And it means?"</p>

<p>"No one knows, and no one cares; it may mean
another curse, for all I know. The Indios either do
not know or will not tell."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" and she drew in a long breath of relief&mdash;"what
the man from Culiacan said to the bell&mdash;the
thing the soldier heard&mdash;was not a curse; it was
only that the beautiful work should be remembered."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, that! But there was a prophecy years
before, when the corner-stone was set in its place
and blessed by the padres, and the Indios were all
there on their knees saying a rosary, and the viceroy
and all the dignitaries. An Indian hunter was also
there from the south, and he was a stranger. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
looked at the thing carved on the corner-stone, and
he looked at the builder, who leaned against the wall
and laughed when the holy water touched it; and the
stranger crossed himself, for his mother was a convert;
but to the captain of the guard he said the thing I
told you, and the captain of the guard was of my
father's family. So it was repeated down to our time."</p>

<p>"But the words&mdash;he said what of a prophecy?"</p>

<p>"He said human blood, and not holy water, must
baptize the stones and the altar of a temple with those
signs. He was afraid the padre would put malediction
on him if he told him that the blessing of a
Christian saint was not so strong as the gods of the
Indians, but he would not stand or kneel beside
the lines where the church was to be, and he would
not tell why he was afraid. He said he did not know
what would happen there: it might be a tidal wave
from the sea in sight, or it might be a pestilence, for
the people were very wicked and very dirty, but it
was marked with a sign for evil, and it would be well
if the walls never went higher."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"They tried to get him to tell the padre, so that
the builder might be whipped, but the stranger Indian
was afraid. He said he wanted to live to see his
children again, and they lived south in the hill country;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
and he ran away when they tried to keep him, but he
had warned some old Indios, and when the first earthquake
cracked the walls, they all remembered."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"The mason laughed, but mended the cracked walls
and went on at work, always singing, always working,
even before sunrise. The old Indios who helped said
it was at sunrise hour only that he worked on the keystones
with the suns and star things, but they maybe
lied. And after the dedication of the church he died
as he lived, laughing and a heretic; and when the
earthquake came and the tower of the bells fell, and
the tiles of the floor were wet with the blood of the
thirty-nine lives crushed out there, then the old Indios
whispered and remembered many things; for the
prophecy of the strange learned Indian of the south
had come true."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;the altar? Did&mdash;some one&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her lips were stiff as with cold, and she could
scarcely articulate.</p>

<p>"Holy God! how white you are, Raquel!" he
exclaimed. "I thought you were not a coward like
the other women. Take this wine&mdash;take it! Por
Dios, but you gave me a fright!"</p>

<p>She swallowed the wine, and smiled absently at his
excitement, and drew the serape closer. She did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
speak again for a long time, just sat staring out toward
the blue of the hills.</p>

<p>"Are you in a trance?" he demanded. "Santa
Maria, but you are a wife to come home to! If I
interest you at all, I have to talk to you of things bad
enough to scare the devil. Now you see why Doña
Maria blows down the walls&mdash;they were accursed
from the beginning. She thinks maybe she is doing
a pious thing, who knows?"</p>

<p>"Selling to others the stone that is accursed?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that is a side issue. But I think truly, Raquelita,
she is afraid of the bishop now, since you
have come. I even think she wants to be friends;
Doña Angela told me. She has promised that she
will build a chapel there of adobe, if the bishop will
give his benediction. Much of bad luck is coming
to them, and she is growing afraid."</p>

<p>"Yes; she has no sense of justice in her; she has
only fear," returned Raquel. "Let her build chapels
if she likes, but the blessing of God was put on those
stone walls, as well as the curse of a heretic, and what
she has done is sacrilege. I will do nothing to countenance
it, or allow it to continue."</p>

<p>"But, at least, you will do one thing," he said,
emphatically. "You have heard enough of the curse
to show you why it is no place for human beings to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
live. Only half the curse is carried out. The tiles
have been baptized by human blood&mdash;but not the
altar. You will stay here with live people, and let
the old ruin wait alone for the curse to be lifted."</p>

<p>"I will go back," she said, with sudden decision,
dropping the serape from around her shoulders and
beginning to braid her hair. "No, you need not
swear like that, Rafael; God would shut His ears if
He heard you. You have told me a fine story of fear,
and some of it may be true, but our duty lies there.
We may lift the curse; we can go back and try."</p>

<p>Her husband sprang to his feet and flung his chair
crashing into the low window opening on a veranda.
The shattered glass fell in a glittering heap, but
the noise of it did not drown his oaths.</p>

<p>"It is no use at all to break the windows of our
friends, Rafael," observed his wife; "and neither the
saints nor Our Lady the Virgin will allow such
curses as yours to be heard. There are dangers
here for&mdash;for both of us, perhaps,&mdash;dangers more
to be afraid of than the walls of the good padres.
I ride back to-day."</p>

<p>"You think of it as all past, that curse?" he demanded,
threateningly. "Well, you think so! Priests
have gone mad there, though the Church keeps it
quiet. Since the year Don Eduardo and Doña Maria
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
bought it, what has happened? All their land is
slipping away. To-day she is building an adobe on
the old Mission ranch, to hold one hundred and sixty
acres in case they lose all the rest of their thirty miles
of ranches. Two of her sons have been killed in the
streets&mdash;one by a woman. All that remains is slipping
slowly through their fingers. It is like a handful
of wheat: the closer they try to hold it, the less
they have in their hands. All they try is of no
use. When they first bought those old walls of the
Mission at Pico's auction, they were masters of
the land, but what of that?"</p>

<p>"If it is a curse, they earned it by tearing down the
temple consecrated to God, that is all!"</p>

<p>"All? Miguel, my brother, blew down no walls;
he did no harm to anything at all. He only bought an
interest in the Mission lands, and claimed some living-rooms
as his share, and he is struck like the others by
the curse, and does not die in his bed either, but is
trampled into the earth until no one can see him!"</p>

<p>"But that may be the other curse working&mdash;the
curse on the Arteagas. You people seem to have
earned a great many! Is it not time some of the
family should try to live for blessings?"</p>

<p>He did not answer, only stared at her with angry
eyes and lips twitching in wrath he could not express.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
She looked at him an instant, and stretched out her
arms wearily. All the glorious world of love about
them, yet never aught of harmony in their two lives
linked together. She had never seen the life domestic
of young people. She did not know what it might
mean to other women, but there were days when she
grew sick with the dread of future years, the endless
prison of her vow, the&mdash;</p>

<p>Suddenly she turned to him with a little gesture
of appeal, almost tremulous. It was such weary
work to battle constantly; and his mother&mdash;</p>

<p>"Rafael," she said, gently, "the blessings are in
the world somewhere&mdash;shall not we try to find them?
The old lives of the maledictions are gone. Ours is
the new life, and we have done no wrong to expiate.
And it may be, if we live as&mdash;as your mother would
have wanted us to live, that the saints&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To the bottom of the sea with your saints!"
he broke in, angrily. "Por Dios! you are always
dragging the dead out of their graves to make the
days like a funeral. I prefer most the picnic in the
hills, and I go to-day."</p>

<p>"So do I," she answered; "but it will be to the
hills of the south by the sea. To-night the moon
shines, and the ride will be better than a picnic of
your political friends."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
"By&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is no sort of use for you to make empty oaths,
Rafael. I leave this town to-day; with you if you
are wise, without you if you are not. But I myself&mdash;I
go!"</p>

<p>He went out and slammed the door, and directly
she heard him tell Juan Castillas that he had married
one of the wooden saints of the Mission come to life.</p>

<p>"I am glad it is not one with the broken glass eyes
and the missing fingers," laughed Juan. "Doña
Raquel is the most beautiful woman in the Californias
to-day."</p>

<p>She turned from the window and looked at herself
in the mirror. The most beautiful woman in the
Californias! Was that so? Could it be? Yet what
was beauty, after all, if&mdash;</p>

<p>Between herself and the glass another face seemed
to arise,&mdash;the blue-eyed childish face for which she
had been forgotten.</p>

<p>"Holy Mother!" she moaned, and covered her
own with her hands. "Of what use is beauty to a
woman who is not beloved?"</p>

<p>"I wasted the holy water on
the doorway of the sala and
the bedroom," grumbled old
Polonia, ensconced among the
serapes on the carreta; "I
should have kept it for the
road to the sea. She rides
away from him alone; but it is a witchcraft, all the
same."</p>

<p>Secretly the old woman gave sympathy to the
handsome Rafael, who loved women of gaiety and fine
clothes. The town was a very good place to stay,
and the band played, and there was a good circus;
and to choose instead a nasty old Mission where
a cross priest scolded, and smoked, and drank himself
stupid each dinner-time! What kind of a girl
would go back there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Still, the old Indian knew that she was not of wood,
like the statues in the old church, let the husband
think as he might! Last night had proven she could
be her mother's own child in a storm of passion. It
was perhaps for the best that she did not love her
husband so madly; for if he should ever prove untrue,&mdash;and
men of course were so&mdash;what might not
happen?</p>

<p>She thought of the witchcraft of the mother, and
crossed herself.</p>

<p>The moon, the beautiful moon of the month
of Mary! shone round and silvered in the blue above
the mountains, as the blaze of the sun sank into the
western sea. South lay the ranch of San Joaquin, and
Raquel, for all her thirty-mile ride, was sorry. She
would have no excuse to ride past; it was the one
slight of the country to pass the house of an acquaintance,
and this family was one deserving of
honor. The soft dusk of warm lands had stretched
over the level. The sweet clover along the road had
a deeper note of perfume, and the patches of mustard
bloom added its own spicy fragrance. Gladly she
would have ridden on alone in the perfect night, but
it would not do. She cared little for the herd of
people, but she always tried to keep in mind what the
Doña Luisa would have done in the little duties
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
toward the opinion of the valley, and she had no idea
of making a scandal, or of appearing to ride in secret
from the town where her husband was still detained.</p>

<p>So, when the dogs barked, she galloped forward
to the ranch-house, and was met with excited welcome
from the mistress and her two vivacious daughters
and their cousin Ana Mendez. All the news of the
town they asked for. They had heard wonderful
things of the courtesy shown her by the new bishop,
who was not given to showing much pronounced
attention to even the devout of the faith. They had
rejoiced each day to hear of the honors showered on
her by the families of the city. It was as if a queen
had arrived in their valley&mdash;and to leave it all and
ride alone in the night!</p>

<p>Ana cut their queries short and bade them see to old
Polonia, that she might be fed and rested well, and
the driver also, and then carried her guest to her own
room, where she put her hands on Raquel's shoulders
and looked into her eyes, and then without a word led
her to the shrine in the corner, where they both knelt.</p>

<p>When the prayer was over and she had seen her
guest supplied with bread, and red wine, and olives,
and sliced beef, she regarded her sadly a moment,
noting that only the wine was swallowed, and that the
girl looked pale in the candle-light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
"Poor little dear," she said, softly, and patted her
shoulder and spoke with the tenderness of intimacy.
"I think now thou wert only a child that morning in
the wedding-veil, when she gave thee that vow and
died. Thou hast such strength in looks, my Raquelita,
no one remembers how young in life thou art. But I
see now how it is. Rafael is the son of my mother's
cousin, and I know that blood! You but give the
word, and my uncle shall ride to Los Angeles in the
morning and say what is right to be said to Rafael.
We know those boys&mdash;Miguel too," and she crossed
herself. "My uncle always look himself to the door-key
when that Miguel Arteaga come with a serenade.
Oh, we know those boys in this valley better than
their mother, who thought to guard Rafael from the
heretics. Holy Mary! No heretic in the land lived
worse than the life on Miguel Arteaga's ranches!"</p>

<p>"That does not make any difference at all," said
the girl, wearily. "I took the vow, '<i>So long as we
both shall live</i>.' That seems a long time, my dear
Ana, but I must have not one other thought in this
life."</p>

<p>"And he sends thee home?"</p>

<p>"No; this is not his fault&mdash;do not think it,"
and she evaded the eyes of Ana. "He will follow,
now that I have come; I am most certain of that; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
he was in a rage, of course, and if I would live there
in the town he would do anything to please me,
almost. But I feel weak some days. I&mdash;I am
not strong enough to fight the people there whom
his mother was afraid of. In my own house they
will not come. In my own valley I may keep my
promise."</p>

<p>"Poor little dear," moaned Ana again. It was a
good hope, and the girl did not seem to have much
else to live for; but Ana had known the Arteaga men
for many years, and had her doubts.</p>

<p>"It is time that Rafael were at home," she conceded.
"Juan Flores is around the range again;
some say El Capitan is with him, and they are on
this side. Last night they had supper at Trabuco
ranch; they did no harm there, but that does not
mean that he will do no harm elsewhere. Avila let
him have horses once when the marshal was close
behind; since that time Avila's house is safe, and
his herds as well."</p>

<p>"And Capitan?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" Ana's tone was carefully careless. "No
one seems certain he is along. He does not so often
come this way; for a year he has been somewhere in
Sonora&mdash;only when the horses are picked for the
government, or the Arteagas have a fine lot broken,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
does he cross to this country. There is where Rafael
needs guarding more than from heretics."</p>

<p>"From Capitan? He&mdash;he&mdash;would not kill&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," said Ana, slowly; "I never think he wants
Rafael to die; he only wants him not to be happy;
always he wants Rafael to remember he is not so far
away but he can do him harm. Rafael hates the
lonely Mission valley on account of that. In a town
Capitan never can make him afraid so much."</p>

<p>"Rafael is not a coward, I think," returned Raquel.</p>

<p>"No, but he knows Capitan does not forget&mdash;there
was a girl between them once. Rafael is the
handsomer, so he got her. Oh, that is long ago.
But Rafael was foolish and laughed too loud, and so
he has to pay!"</p>

<p>"But I think that is a mistake. I heard all about
the trouble; his mother told me. Capitan fights the
government only, and takes horses from the Arteagas
because they go with the Americanos as friends; that
is all. We heard it all at San Luis Rey as we drove
north&mdash;you remember?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I am not forgetting that," and Ana
laughed. "I listen all the time to what his mother
thinks she knows about that; and it is true, too, but
not all the truth. I could tell you&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped suddenly, not certain it was wise to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
tell the girl the thing causing her amusement, for, after
all, it was not really funny; it was serious enough in
itself, it might frighten the girl very much. No
other in her place would live one hour in the valley,
or ride at night with only one man and an old Indian
woman as guard.</p>

<p>"If you know that I have been told lies, you had
better tell me the truth," said Raquel. "It may cost
me more to find it out alone than to hear it from a
friend."</p>

<p>"That is true," agreed Ana, after a moment of
thought. She went to the door and looked in the
outer room to be sure no curious ears were there.
She could hear ecstatic cries from the girls, who were
giving old Polonia good things to eat, and plying her
with endless questions. She was recounting the brilliant
worldly scenes her old eyes had lately witnessed,
and pitying herself a little that she could not remain;
for each day had been finer than the day before.
And the horse-races, and the fine cavaliers, and Doña
Raquel always in the finest carriage&mdash;Holy Mary!
but it was a thing to see!</p>

<p>Ana closed the door tightly and came back and sat
down beside Raquel and took her hand.</p>

<p>"My aunt and the girls are over their heads in delight
out there," she remarked, dryly; "and I will tell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
you a thing no one has been told concerning that ride
from San Luis Rey. Rafael lost some fine horses
that night&mdash;do you remember?"</p>

<p>Raquel did not; she might have heard&mdash;but Doña
Luisa's death, all that sorrow, all the many and quick
changes, had blotted out the fainter records of that
day.</p>

<p>"Well, when we stopped for coffee at the camp the
cook told us; you may not have heard. However,
they were taken after you went into the river. You
have not forgotten that?"</p>

<p>"How could I? Oh, yes, I remember! The priest
told me that night. How strange it should have all
been crowded out of my mind! He told me to give
Rafael a message of warning. What was it? What
was it?"</p>

<p>She clasped her hands over her brows and tried to
remember. Her first meeting with Rafael beside the
dead body of his mother had driven out of her mind
the message she was to have delivered. It was a
warning, a warning of some sort; that much she was
sure of, and&mdash;what was it about her father&mdash;her
father's name?</p>

<p>"I think," said Ana, speaking softly and watching
her, "that he told you Felipe Estevan's daughter had
saved Rafael Arteaga a treasure that night."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
"Anita! So he did; and you know the words, the
very words he spoke to me!"</p>

<p>"I know more, Raquel mia; I know what the treasure
was."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"It is not nice to tell," and Ana hesitated. "But
he saw you there that evening with his own eyes."</p>

<p>"The priest?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the priest. He saved you from being carried
to the hills by the Juan Flores robbers, while Capitan
took others of the men and secured the chests of
wedding gifts from the old Mission. Oh, it was all
planned for the one big revenge on Rafael Arteaga.
But he saw you, and so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And that priest saved me from them, Anita?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he saved you&mdash;the priest&mdash;and sent you back
to your friends, and sent the men across the mesas&mdash;because
you were Estevan's daughter. But he did not
try to save Rafael's horses; that night many of the
finest were headed eastward and never came back."</p>

<p>"And if&mdash;if the padre had not been there at the
right moment, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is not a nice story, at all," acknowledged Ana.
"They are rough men. One of them would have married
you, and you would never have cared to see your
friends again, and Rafael never would have found you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
"Mother of God! He hates Rafael like that, yet
lets him live?"</p>

<p>Ana laughed a little and shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Capitan is like that," she observed. "No one is
like him. If Rafael's life were in danger this hour,
Capitan would ride to save him. Oh, he does not
mean that he shall die while young, and handsome,
and rich, and beloved!"</p>

<p>Her tone had a little hard ring for a moment; her
eyes were sparkling with a certain admiration for the
character she was describing. The story had brought
the color back to Raquel's face, and she listened feverishly.
What strange, strange things could be possible
in the smiling valleys of San Juan! For the moment
she forgot the dull ache in her heart which had driven
her to ride alone back to sanctuary.</p>

<p>"And you know all this, Anita; even the words of
the padre! How?"</p>

<p>She caught Ana's hands in hers impetuously, and
made her look in her eyes.</p>

<p>"He told me," said her friend, simply.</p>

<p>"Then you know him? You see him sometimes?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes."</p>

<p>"And he is called&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Libertad."</p>

<p>"Padre Libertad&mdash;the Liberated? I never have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
heard him spoken of. Where can I find him?
Anita, I will go alone, but this feud shall be ended.
He will help me. And I&mdash;I never knew what he
saved me from that night. I scarcely thanked him.
He was so strange, so abrupt, so masterful, I accepted
all he did, and never knew! Tell me. Anita. I will
go to him&mdash;I will&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No one goes to him," said Ana. "He never stays
in one place. If you see him, you see him&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But he comes to San Juan?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he comes to San Juan once a year at
least, so they will not forget him."</p>

<p>Ana's lips curled in a little smile, quickly suppressed.</p>

<p>"But, Anita, that he tells you all these things, so
that you know the reasons of Capitan&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Capitan is a sort of cousin of our family.
Even when he is outcast, I do not want him to lose
his soul; so I&mdash;my people do not know&mdash;but always
I pay for a mass when I hear that the robbers have
killed a man. I never think that Capitan would like
to kill; still, it might happen. So I remember&mdash;as
I remembered him when I was a little girl, and when I
was married&mdash;and I pay for a mass, that is all."</p>

<p>"I am glad to-night, very glad you tell me all this,
Anita. Not glad that it is so, but, thanks to God, it
is something to do&mdash;to do&mdash;to do!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
"And what?" asked Ana, regarding her curiously.
Heretofore the wife of Rafael had appeared to her
self-restrained and cold, but to-night&mdash;</p>

<p>Raquel caught her hand and pressed it, and laughed.</p>

<p>"You are saving me to-night, Anita, and you do
not know it," she said, with feverish intensity. "I was
unhappy when I rode to your door; so tired of all the
world that I could think of nothing sweeter than to ride
on and on to the sea, and into it, and go to sleep there."</p>

<p>"Raquel! That is a mortal sin!"</p>

<p>"So it is, but I shall do penance, and when the
padre comes again, O my dear Ana, you alone will not
pay for the masses; we can do many things for good
together, you and I. You must come to me to the
Mission; you must! I have had many things to fight
alone, Anita, and I never can tell you what they are.
But this new thing we can fight together, darling&mdash;you
for your relation and I for my husband and my
promise; and, the saints helping us, we shall win,
Anita, and it will all come right; and thanks to God I
came to you this night!"</p>

<p>Her eyes were alight with excitement, her cheeks
flushed and burning. Once or twice she shivered
slightly; and Ana, who had been reassured by the
beautiful color so quickly replacing the pallor of the
cheeks, grew all at once apprehensive, as she noticed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
that the hands of Raquel were very cold indeed, and
that her laugh was nervous, and that her teeth chattered,
and that the words she tried to utter grew indistinct.</p>

<p>"Holy Mary! I have given her a fever," gasped
Ana. "That my tongue had been blistered, before I
babbled all that to her! Raquel, for the love of God
don't shake like that, and don't laugh at me! Stop
it! The laugh is the worst of all! Raquel&mdash;Raquelita&mdash;darling
mine!"</p>

<p>But Ana's frenzy of fear was so irresistibly funny,
that Raquel continued to laugh, and the laughter grew
louder after the other women were called in, and helped
to undress her and wrap her in blankets to smother the
chill. That night, candles never went out in the house,
and Ana knelt before the altar with prayers to the saints
that they might undo the folly of her tongue. But
old Polonia knelt instead by the couch of Raquel and
cursed the American, that he had not died there in
Mexico.</p>

<p>In the early dawn Polonia crept unseen to the aquia,
and of soft clay made an image of him, and thrust pins
through every vital portion of it, that there might be
no chance left of life in the man it represented; then,
having finished her work, she left it where the sun
would dry it, and crept back to the room and curled up
on a rug, and slept the sleep of the content.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
The good holy water she had paid money for had
failed. But there are always two ways. If the saints
refuse to help, there is always the devil left. If the
padres did not get more effective holy water, whose
fault was it that poor souls had to seek help elsewhere?
She would do penance, of course, after the man died,
and perhaps pay for a mass, and that would make it all
right for everybody, and was so easy! She went to sleep
wondering if he would die from a slow lingering disease,
or how it would be. It was inconvenient that one was
not allowed to select the very way the end must come.
But the devil would know what she would like best,&mdash;that
the foot of his horse might go down in a gopher-hole
and pitch him on his head just so that the neck
would break, quick, like the snapping of a finger. And
no one would ever guess how it had been brought
about!</p>

<p>Tea made of Castillian rose petals,
and all the other little helps of
the herb family, were brewed
and steamed in the kitchen of
the ranch for the saving of Raquel
from the grasp of a strength-sapping
fever.</p>

<p>Conscience-stricken, Ana fought and argued against
sending for Rafael. Every hour of the day and night
she was willing to watch and work, if only Raquel's
illness might pass without the cause of it being known;
and she was certain that the cause was the shock of
learning how narrowly she had escaped kidnapping at
the hands of Rafael's enemy.</p>

<p>Sometimes, indeed, Raquel did murmur in her sleep
of "Padre Libertad" and the water surging over her
head; and then again it was "the altar&mdash;the altar&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the blood on the tiles of the temple"; then "the
ring&mdash;the ring&mdash;the ring." Sometimes she would
moan that the beautiful one with the happiness must
not receive the ring&mdash;never the ring of Aztec witchery!
Then her words would trail along in inarticulate
whispers, and sink into brief periods of slumber.</p>

<p>Old Polonia, listening and watching, heard all. Of
Padre Libertad and the dream of the water she cared
not anything. Of the ring she understood, and was
afraid lest a name be uttered. But when the girl
moaned of the blood on the altar and on the floor of
the temple, the old creature dropped in a cowering
heap and screamed with fear, and begged with tears
that the husband would come, and that a padre must
come, for it was all of no use to do any more of anything;
and that the mother of Doña Raquel had come
from&mdash;from death, to tell of hidden things to her
daughter, and it meant that death was in the home
with them, and that Doña Raquel would never again
sing with the birds, or gallop across the mesas!</p>

<p>Ana, trembling with fright and this assurance, almost
smothered old Polonia, that the others might not hear
the wild prophecy, but without further delay she sent
a letter to Rafael, and the man who bore it was to
spare neither horses nor himself on the errand.</p>

<p>The man rode well, and made only one halt to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
change a horse at a ranch. The sheriff of Los Angeles
County, and many owners of ranches, were there.
The sheriff looked at the rider and his reeking horse
carefully.</p>

<p>"From where do you come?" he asked, and the
man jerked his thumb toward the south.</p>

<p>"San Joaquin."</p>

<p>"What's up there?"</p>

<p>"Not anything, señor."</p>

<p>It never entered his head that a woman sick at the
San Joaquin ranch would have interest for a party of
horsemen who looked as if out for a hunt. But the
party exchanged glances. One of them, a farmer who
knew him, stepped forward.</p>

<p>"Where do you ride in such haste, if nothing is
up?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I take a letter to Don Rafael; his wife is sick."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"At San Joaquin ranch, señor. Adios!"</p>

<p>He had his foot in the stirrup, when the sheriff laid
his hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"Wait a bit," he said, quietly. "I think it is said
that a picnic is given to-day by Señora Downing for
Doña Raquel Arteaga who is visiting in Los Angeles.
How can she be at the same time at the San Joaquin
ranch?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
"I know not anything of the picnic, señor, but I
know a woman rode her horse into the ranch at dark
last night, and they say it is Doña Raquel Arteaga; and
she has a fever, and screams and laughs all night in the
room of Doña Ana. I know, for I am called after I
am asleep, to get wood for a fire. No one sleeps, and
outside the window I hear all what she screams, and it
is enough to freeze the blood,&mdash;all of altars where blood
is, and a ring that she cries for; and I am glad to get
away and ride for Rafael Arteaga."</p>

<p>"Rather thin, isn't it, all of that story?" remarked
one of the ranchmen. "Bryton, when we asked you
to join us didn't you stop to send word to the Downings
that you couldn't attend their little celebration
in the hills?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Bryton had turned from the others and was rolling
a cigarro. He replied without looking up from his
task.</p>

<p>"And it was given in honor of Doña Raquel Arteaga
and the bishop?"</p>

<p>"I understood so."</p>

<p>"Understood? Why, that was the reason Arteaga
gave for refusing to come along," broke in one of the
other men. "I heard him."</p>

<p>"That's so; I did too, and I thought at the time a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
picnic for a woman and a priest was a mighty small
excuse to give for evading&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Careful!" And the sheriff shot a warning glance at
the speaker. "A newly married man was excused, even
in Bible times, from going to the wars, so Arteaga's
reason is all right."</p>

<p>"Just a moment," said Bryton. "I am as certain as
it is possible to be of anything one does not see, that
the boy tells the truth. She is there, and she is ill. Let
him take the message."</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?" and the sheriff eyed
him carefully. Bryton's jaw set stolidly, though his
face flushed.</p>

<p>"I know it; that's all," he said, briefly, as he turned away.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The boy is speaking the truth; I know it!"</p>

<p>The sheriff looked after him a moment, and then
spoke to one of the others.</p>

<p>"Just keep the boy here a bit until I can see clearer,"
he said, "if Bryton knows."</p>

<p>He tramped after Bryton, who was going for his own
horse tied in the shadow of a pepper tree.</p>

<p>"Bryton, tell me <i>how</i> you know!"</p>

<p>"I can't do it. Take my word or ignore it, as you like."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
"But, hell, man! it is not your word; it is only your
impression! Give me your word as to how you know
it, and I'll take it quick. I suppose it's some inside
family history you've dropped on; but the lady is at
Los Angeles, and it is some other woman they are
nursing at the ranch and deceiving the servants about.
That is my theory. There are some women mixed
up with that Flores outfit, and I happen to know that
El Capitan, who is the brain of the gang, is related to
the folks at that ranch. Now, is it reasonable to think
that Arteaga's wife would ride at dark, alone, over this
country where hold-ups are so common? Would he
let her? Would not the Downings have known?"</p>

<p>"They probably did know, and Rafael Arteaga
certainly did," returned Bryton, impatiently. "Their
picnic was more a matter of policy than a pleasure party.
They wanted the bishop there, to put an end to that
church fight. They wanted Doña Raquel Arteaga to
serve as an attraction and help them. She has absolutely
refused all along to assist with any compromise;
and to avoid it this time she has evidently ridden quietly
out of Los Angeles, and her husband, who wanted the
picnic very much, has kept her absence a secret."</p>

<p>"But if she is as sick as this boy says, how could
she take a thirty-mile ride on horseback?"</p>

<p>Bryton made a gesture of impatience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
"She is there!" he insisted. "I&mdash;I feel that she is
there. The sooner you let the boy ride for Arteaga
and the doctor, the less likely she is to die."</p>

<p>"Doctor! Did he say anything about a doctor?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You see, if the woman was very ill, the fellow
would say it was a doctor he was riding for."</p>

<p>"No; it would be a priest. These women do their
own doctoring. If herb teas and prayers can't save a
life, it is let die. Good God! She may be dying now
while we talk. Let the boy go!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be damned!"</p>

<p>The sheriff was staring at Bryton, whose face was
white and set. He was untying his horse, with quick
decided movements, and cinching up the girth.</p>

<p>"If you don't send the boy on that errand, I'll go
myself," he said, curtly.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I'll be&mdash;" The sheriff broke his sentence
midway, to stare at Bryton in amazement. "What the
devil is it to you?" he demanded. "Arteaga is no
bosom friend of yours, is he?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of. If the boy doesn't go, I go!
The girl may be dying, and the help she wants, she's
going to get. Speak up!"</p>

<p>He was in the saddle, and the sheriff, with one look
at him, walked back to the group.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
"Boy, do you carry only a message to Don Rafael
Arteaga?" he demanded, "or is it a written letter?"</p>

<p>"A letter," said he, sullenly, "and Doña Ana raise
the hell if you don't let me take it."</p>

<p>"Ah! The Doña Ana! I thought so. Doña Ana
is an interesting little lady. Let me see the letter."</p>

<p>The man hesitated, but finally pulled the letter from
his pocket. The sheriff took it and walked back to
Bryton.</p>

<p>"I'm humoring your queer notion all I know how,"
he observed; "for I want you south with us instead of
taking the back trail. You read Spanish; the letter is
not sealed. Read it."</p>

<p>Bryton read it aloud, slowly. Ana had not minced
her words.</p>
<div class='blkquote'>
<p>"<span class="smcap">Rafael Arteaga</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"For the love of God, come quick to Raquel.
Among us, some way, I think we have killed her.
That she is too good for you is no reason that
you should let her ride alone with a heart-break.
I think myself she does not want to live any more,&mdash;and
no medicine cures that. Maybe you cannot
cure it either, but it is your place to be here if she
dies.</p>
<p style='margin-left:6em;'>"Your cousin,</p>
<p style='margin-left:9em;'>"Ana Carmencita Mendez."</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
"You see," said Bryton, handing it back. "I told you."</p>

<p>"I see," conceded the sheriff. "It reads all right,
but there is always a chance of&mdash;" He folded the
paper thoughtfully, and stared hard at the ground.
"This is all a ticklish business, Bryton, and if
Flores's friends have got wind of this little <i>pasear</i>
of ours, they may send all sorts of scare messages
where they will do most good. These greasers have
tricks of their own, and most of them are cousins&mdash;see?"</p>

<p>"I see; but that is not a message of that sort.
Does the boy take it, or do I?"</p>

<p>"The boy takes it, and I'll send a man with him
to be sure he takes that message and no other; and
you, if you are so keen for the road, can ride south
and investigate before Cousin Ana can expect any
reply to her message."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;ride alone to San Joaquin ranch?"</p>

<p>"That's it! You've got the best horse in the
bunch. If the whole outfit rides in, they'll get scared,
but one man alone on his way to San Juan, that
looks all right. You may chance on things worth
while, when we finally catch up."</p>

<p>"But there are other men&mdash;men who know the family better."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
"Not one would be so apt to note the points we
need. The family is square, but of Cousin Ana there
have been some curious things said. She is the one
of the lot who openly claims El Capitan as cousin.
That's all we really know, but keep your eyes open."</p>

<p>"Let me see the letter again."</p>

<p>The sheriff handed it to him and looked at him
curiously as he half turned away to read it, and his
eyes sought out the one statement: "I think myself
she does not want to live any more, and no medicine
cures that. Maybe you cannot cure it either, but it
is your place to be here if she dies."</p>

<p>He pulled his hat low over his eyes and gathered
up the reins.</p>

<p>"All right," he said, briefly. "I will go. Adios!"</p>

<p>A little later, and only a cloud of dust marked the
way in the south that he had gone; and the mist in
his eyes, hidden so well from the sheriff, was dashed
away by his hand, but came back again and again.</p>

<p>"It is your place to be here if she dies," he
repeated, grimly,&mdash;"my Doña Espiritu&mdash;my beloved!
The message was written to him, but fate sent it first
to me, and I&mdash;I will be with you to-night. You will
not be again alone with the heart-break."</p>

<p>Toward evening Raquel grew
more quiet, and Ana, seeing
that the fever was abating, gave
herself much blame for sending
in such haste for Rafael; and
what she had written to him
only the good saints could
tell, for she had been so frightened she had possibly
told him unpleasant things!</p>

<p>However, all things could be endured if only
Raquel would open her eyes in reason once more,
and lift the load of self-blame from the heart of Ana.</p>

<p>Not only the young girls, but the mistress as
well, kept a respectful distance from the room where
Raquel lay, adjoining the hall. Her moans and
strange words had filled them with dread, but no
more so than had the grovelling fear of the old
Indian woman. All day she had crouched at the door
like a patient animal, waiting the end. Sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
she muttered to herself in queer Indian words, sometimes
she crept to the couch of Doña Raquel for a
little while, and then back again to the door, always
mumbling or praying, and always insisting that the
mother of Raquel had come from the grave to tell
things, and that the last of the kings was gone now
for always!</p>

<p>Any attempt at a question, any interpretation of
her mutterings, would arouse her to a realization
that she was among new people in a strange land,
and her lips would shut in a straight line, to be kept
shut so long as she was conscious of their presence.</p>

<p>The Indian servants crept past the door, with
fearful eyes fixed in dread. She was of another race
and another tongue than their own forebears, straight
and slender even in her old age; darkest reddish-bronze
in color, while a San Juan grandmother was
always fat, and nearly always black. Beside them,
Polonia looked almost Caucasian. Yet she proudly
denied any white blood; she was an Indian of a hill
tribe of the south, the name of which she would not
utter.</p>

<p>All this, and her mutterings, and the wild words
of her mistress, put terror into the heart of the San
Joaquin household. The girls huddled together and
whispered tales of witches and ghosts, and thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
she looked like each in turn; and Doña Ana got
great credit for courage in staying in the room with
her in the night-time.</p>

<p>But all their vague fears were changed to a
definite terror when one of the Indian children
found the clay image by the aquia, and in its yet
moist members all the pins, for the stealing of which
half the children around the ranch had that morning
received a taste of the rope's end.</p>

<p>Such a gray-faced, wailing lot as scampered up
from the aquia! Girls screaming, old women wailing,
and the mothers herding the children out of
reach of the accursed thing!</p>

<p>All was explained now, about the sudden awful
sickness of the Doña Raquel! The Indian woman
from the south was a very devil! Doña Raquel
had perhaps had to whip her some time, and she had
waited until she was with her in a strange house to
do this thing: that was why she crouched at the door
as if on guard; she was afraid some one might
enter to pray, or with holy water, or any of the
helps of the saints. And after the life had gone from
Doña Raquel, who could tell that she might not kill
others, even all of them on the ranch? Since she had
in one hour's time changed her mistress from a well
woman to a crazy woman who laughed, how long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
would it take to do the same for a dozen? Not a
day! In a week she could kill them all!</p>

<p>Panic seized the entire herd. They raced in terror
for the ranch-house and overwhelmed the mistress
with their fears. Her daughters clung together, white-faced
at the frenzy facing them. The men were out
on the ranch and ranges; Don Enrico was with them,
and there was no one to control the dark mob of
fanatic faces, any more than one could head a stampeding
herd of cattle: that was what terror developed
in them&mdash;the mad, unreasoning rush of animals to
trample underfoot, or tear to pieces, the thing they
feared.</p>

<p>The mistress could only gasp, "Pray to God&mdash;pray
to God!" but her voice was lost in the tumult
of the wild chorus. It was too late for prayers;
prayers were no good after a devil had got hold
of any one! Then there was only one thing to do,
and they had the knife for the meat and the axe
for the wood! A devil could be burned out, or
drowned out, and there was not water enough this
side of the sea for the drowning; therefore&mdash;</p>

<p>In vain their mistress screamed, and her daughters
clung to the bare brown arms of their serving-women.
They were thrown aside in the stampede of the savage
herd. Let the lady say what should be done with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
white blood; but this was an Indian, and an Indian
of a strange tribe and country!</p>

<p>Even in their panic the bovine cowardly herd
remembered that fact; there would be no Indian
relatives of the witch to wreak vengeance on them;
she was the devil's own, and she had no other
kindred!</p>

<p>They tore across the hall, sacred at other times to
the family, and Ana, rising in wonder at the tumult,
was met at the door by the mob. She retreated to the
couch of Raquel, with outstretched arms to protect
her guest, as she commanded that they be gone.</p>

<p>Her words were scarcely heard. At the door,
crouching, and with covered head, they found her
they wanted, and dragged her unresisting through the
hall and out into the open.</p>

<p>The mistress, sick and half fainting, stumbled to
her own room, and cowered at the altar, with one
daughter clinging to her and sobbing, while the other
stood at the portal of the patio and called for some
of the boys, or a man, or horse for any one who could
ride for help and stop the horror.</p>

<p>"Mother of God! They make the fire!" she screamed.</p>

<p>It was true. They were dragging the wood and
making ready for a fire. Children followed their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
mothers, gathering leaves and straw. One black-skinned
creature had brought a shovel of coals, and
was lying prone on the ground beside it, blowing it
with her breath until it glowed and sent demoniac
lights into her heavy-lidded eyes. One old hag held
the devil's witness, the clay image, before the accused,
and after one brief look Polonia made no struggle.
It was fate; she had known from the feverish words
of Doña Raquel that some one must die as sacrifice.</p>

<p>Then she began to croon a strange whining chant,
and the hands of those holding her fell away in sudden
terror of even the touch of her. Slowly she
stumbled to her feet, and looked at the sun, and
raising her old hands toward its lowering light, waved
them to and fro in weird salutation, never checking
the strange song or chant.</p>

<p>Ana had a pistol, and stood in wavering uncertainty
as to whether she should run out, or stay on
guard beside Raquel; but to the final adjuration she
responded as one suddenly aroused from a stupor of
fear, and rushing to the little plaza she screamed
loudly and then fired two shots in quick succession;
then after a deliberate little pause she fired once
more, and with pale cheeks turned toward the door,
trembling, and waiting.</p>

<p>"God be praised! See, help is coming," gasped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Juanita, pointing northward. "Good! The dust&mdash;the
man on the horse&mdash;and how he rides&mdash;how he
rides!"</p>

<p>Ana watched the rider, fascinated and weak with
terror. Juanita was laughing and crying with joy, but
her cousin stood pale and motionless, and said not a
word as the horseman swept past the garden to the
back of the house, where smoke was rolling up in a
white cloud.</p>

<p>He was none too soon. The fire was leaping in
long tongues from the crackling sycamore boughs.
The dark faces of the fanatics were alight with frenzied
eagerness for their pious task of destroying a witch
before they might be interfered with. They had
heard the screams and shots, and knew what they
meant, and the log they were tying the witch to was
held upright by many willing hands.</p>

<p>Her hands were already tied together; there was
nothing left to do but fasten a rope around her at the
waist, and toss both log and witch into the hottest
corner.</p>

<p>And then Juanita ran screaming toward the group,
and back of her rode a man on a fiend of a horse,
knocking the pious devotees right and left, and caught
up the limp figure of old Polonia and flung it on the
saddle in front of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
She opened her eyes and looked at him once as he
raised her from the ground, and then closed them
and looked no more. It was all of no use&mdash;neither
the holy water to keep away the thought of him,
nor the witchcraft to take the life from him. It
was the accursed Americano, and the charm had only
served to bring him more quickly!</p>

<p>After the first staggering blow from the stranger's
horse, some of the stronger spirits rallied, and lunged
forward to drag the woman from her rescuer, while
others lashed his horse that it might become uncontrollable.
Two able-bodied wenches held on like
grim death, despite the quirt which he brought down
across their shoulders again and again, while he held
the horse and Polonia with one arm.</p>

<p>The animal, between the lashing of the mob and
the roaring of the flames, was leaping madly, and the
rider had all he could do to control its terror. Any
moment a shot, or a club, or a stone thrown at his
own head might give them two victims instead of one.
That was Juanita's one wild fear. She screamed for
Ana with the pistol, but Ana had sunk down, white
and trembling on the doorstep, as she saw a black
form suddenly appear in the midst of the howling mob
of savages. An instant she saw him on the outer
edge of the leaping, struggling circle, and the next he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
was by the head of the horse, and a strong arm struck
right and left until there was space enough to show
he was a bronzed, bearded man in a priest's habit.</p>

<p>"Back to your kennels, dogs!" he cried, sharply.
"Since when have ye dared strike at gentlemen? On
your knees, every one of you! On your knees!"</p>

<p>The younger girls and children dropped in the dust,
but some of the older were less willing to give up.</p>

<p>"She is a witch, father; she is killing a woman,"
cried one; "it is right a devil be put in the fire!"</p>

<p>"Then how hot must the fire be made when your
day comes!" he replied, and raised his hand and spoke
slowly, solemnly, "Thrice heated will that fire be
for the thrice-accursed! To your knees, in the name
of God!"</p>

<p>With sullen, shamed, disappointed faces, they
obeyed. A white man who is a stranger they dared
attack, if enough of them were together, but not a
priest&mdash;a priest who could hit hard enough to knock
a bull down.</p>

<p>"That was a close shave, padre," observed the
American, with a breath of relief. "They had this
poor old wretch almost pulled in two&mdash;will you take
her?"</p>

<p>The priest made a step forward, and then halted
and smiled, as in vague perplexity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
"I have not the pleasure of understanding English,"
he said, gently.</p>

<p>Ana arose and came forward; she was still very
pale and still trembling; she looked at the priest
and tried to speak, but the words were smothered in
a half sob.</p>

<p>"My daughter," he said, quietly, "take courage."
Then he glanced at the pistol still in her hand. "It
was you who fired? That was right. I was on the
hill in the edge of the wood, and it is well you sent
that warning. Your American friend said&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I speak a little Spanish too," remarked Bryton,
in that tongue; "it is the woman with the tied
hands I wanted you to take."</p>

<p>The padre did so, untying the rope deftly, and
steadying her wavering figure, while Bryton slipped
from the saddle, and spoke to Juanita, who had the
one welcoming face he had seen.</p>

<p>"I know you," she said, eagerly. "Did I not see
you at San Juan Capistrano, at Alvara's and at the
Mission? I was sure of it. This is my cousin
Doña Ana and Father&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Libertad," the padre interrupted, briefly, and spoke
directly to Bryton, "from Mexico."</p>

<p>"You will think us all savages to allow this,
father," and she pointed to the huddled Indians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
and the leaping flames; "but it was all so quick&mdash;like
that&mdash;no one could think! My mother is in
hiding from it, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Father," said Ana, speaking for the first time, "a
priest is needed in the house. We have a woman
who may be dying. Will you come quickly?"</p>

<p>She was eager to separate the priest from the others,
and, her speech was nervous and eager.</p>

<p>"Dying?" he repeated, "is that what they meant
when they said the Indian had killed a woman?"</p>

<p>"Yes, father," broke in the quavering tones of old
Altagrazia, "here it is&mdash;the devil she made!" and she
held up the clay image, from which the head had been
broken in the <i>mêlée</i>. "One day ago the lady is well
and rides like a caballero, and this day the sun goes
down and she dies. The Indian from Mexico put on
the curse!"</p>

<p>Old Polonia understood, and screamed denials in
her native tongue, and then turned to the padre and
pointed to the American.</p>

<p>"It is that man!" she cried, shrilly, "he is a
devil! He does not die&mdash;not for anything! And
while he lives he breaks the heart of my mistress. It
is he; that is the man! Put on him the curse of the
Church, father! Put on him the curse to send him
to a desert where he never can find a road again!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
The padre smiled grimly. "That is all they use
their religion for after a century of Christianity," he
observed. "They still stick to their devil-worship,
and call on the Church only when they want maledictions
or absolution. Woman, you talk like a fool.
Did you do this?"</p>

<p>He took the headless clay pin-cushion and held it
before him. Polonia flashed one vindictive glance at
him and then nodded her head sullenly. It was bad
luck to lie to a padre.</p>

<p>"It was to save her," she muttered, "but the Americano
is a devil, and nothing kills him."</p>

<p>She turned one glance of hate and fear upon her
rescuer, and moved toward the house.</p>

<p>"She means you?" asked the padre.</p>

<p>"Oh, she is crazy, that old Indian," cried Juanita;
"always she makes me afraid. The Señor Bryton
she never perhaps has seen until this minute. That
is her thanks that he pull her from the fire!"</p>

<p>The padre turned for one level look at the pale
face of Ana.</p>

<p>"Your name is Bryton?" he then said, quietly.
"Will you, Señor Bryton, see that these savages do
not attempt another roasting, while I look to the
woman who is dying?"</p>

<p>Bryton turned to Juanita.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
"Is it so bad as that?" he asked. "The Doña
Raquel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We think she is better this evening; still, it may
be a fever coming; one never knows. Ah! there are
my father and the men."</p>

<p>Don Enrico Cordoba and some vaqueros rode
madly through the corral and into the place of the
huge bonfire and the still kneeling Indians. Now
that their white heat of passion was over, they remembered
only the beating they would get, and crouched
doggedly where the padre had bidden them; the
younger ones wept with fear when Juanita told her
father the story.</p>

<p>"Holy God!" he shouted in a rage, breaking in
on her recital. "In my house to trample on my
family and drag a woman to the fire! Tomás, count
every head and remember every name. In three
days every one shall be tied to a tree and whipped; if
one runs away, she shall be caught and whipped twice,&mdash;once
here on the ranch, and once on the Mission
plaza of San Juan, on a Sunday after mass. You
cattle, you dogs, you devils, begone from my sight!"</p>

<p>He struck right and left with the green-hide reata,
spurring his horse after those who stumbled along too
slowly to suit him, striking old and young alike as
they ran wailing with terror at the promises he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
made them, and which they knew would be kept.
The Mexican master was quite as prone as the Indian
servants to find acute methods of torture or punishment.</p>

<p>When all were despatched he rode back, puffing
and laughing, to his daughters and guest, with whom
he shook hands heartily.</p>

<p>"Holy saints! but we did ride when we saw the
smoke; it looked like the house on fire. It winds a
man, a ride like that at my age," and he shook his fat
sides with laughter. "Come inside and have a glass
of whiskey, Señor Bryton. We met at the alcalde's
last year when the army officers were in San Juan?
Yes, I thought so. I am glad you have come to
my house, and&mdash;who knows&mdash;you maybe saved my
wife and my daughters as well as the old woman.
When these savages get the taste of blood, they
are crazy wolves, never fighters in the open, brave
only when there is a mob like that. Come in, come
in! Juanita, go tell your mother we have a guest
who has saved you all. What was it you said of
a padre? where is he?"</p>

<p>"With Doña Raquel, father."</p>

<p>"She is worse?"</p>

<p>"We do not know, but thanks to the Virgin, she
no longer laughs or cries. Ana is there. If she live
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
or die, we all feel the padre has come if the husband
do not."</p>

<p>"Humph! Oh, yes, yes, always the priests!" he
grunted. "Women can't keep house without the
padres. I think I build a chapel for my women;
then they can pray all the time to be sure they save
my soul," and he laughed skeptically; then he tossed
aside his sombrero, and brought bottles and glasses to
a little table of marble on the veranda. "Will you
have whiskey, or the bottle of wine?"</p>

<p>"I prefer your own wine of the ranch, Don Enrico,"
and Bryton poured out the white moselle, of
which the Cordoba family was justly proud; "I think
the padre was also off a journey, señor; perhaps a
swallow of this fine wine&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, let the women alone to look after the wants
of the padre," laughed his host. "They own my
house when they are in it, though sometimes I never
see them. 'How much money do you want?' I
say when they come, and that ends my business with
the padres! I buy and sell with them and get beaten
at <i>monte</i> or <i>malilla</i>, but I let women do the praying
with them! Here comes my wife. Refugia, this
is the preserver of your house, the Señor Bryton.
Have some whiskey, dear; you are still pale."</p>

<p>"Pale! Never shall I get over this day. Think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
of the shame of it! Doña Raquel Arteaga has been
entertained like a queen by the bishop, and when she
honors our home, her servant is dragged out to be
burned! The word will go out that we are savages.
Enrico, never so long as you live do you leave this
house again without a man in it!"</p>

<p>"Surely not. Drink the whiskey, dear, and be
composed."</p>

<p>Doña Refugia drank the fiery liquor, and appeared
to enjoy it very much, but it had not a quieting
influence. It rather helped her to remember and
recount all the details of her own stages of fear during
the stampede of the self-appointed executioners.</p>

<p>"After the night we all had," she lamented, "to
have it followed by such a day! God grant that
Doña Raquel slept or was unconscious through it all.
Had she seen those fiends, it might have killed her
or brought back the fever. Juanita says a padre has
come, which is the one lucky thing."</p>

<p>"Señor Bryton came first, which was a more lucky
thing," said her husband; "all the saints could not
have saved the woman from the fire if he had not
come when he did. Such a thing has not happened
here in this valley since I was a boy. Have some
more of the wine; it will give you an appetite for
supper."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
At the mention of supper his wife remembered that
all the help of the kitchen might have deserted the
premises under the scourging of Don Enrico's reata,
and calling the girls to help, she left the gentlemen to
their glasses.</p>

<p>At the hall she halted to ask after Raquel, and in the
shadow saw her niece and the padre talking softly.
Ana's head was bent as though weeping, and the hand
of the padre was smoothing her hair, and his words
were reassuring.</p>

<p>"There, there! it is not so bad, after all," he was
saying. "You did the best you knew; and now that
I am here, there is nothing to do but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know," broke in Ana; "you say all this so
I will not blame myself. You would do the same
if the worst, the very worst, happened."</p>

<p>"It is not going to happen," he said, quietly;
then, as he saw Doña Refugia in the hall, "Your
friend is surely not so dangerously ill as you fear;
by to-morrow&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ana looked up quickly at his change of tone, and
arose to her feet.</p>

<p>"Here is my aunt," she said. "Aunt Refugia,
this is a padre journeying south to Mexico. He&mdash;he
came at the right moment to help Señor Bryton,
and I have asked him to stay&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
"Of course," said Doña Refugia, promptly. "Thanks
to God you are here this night! Show him to the
padre's room, Ana, while I see to supper. Is she
sleeping?" she asked, nodding toward the couch.</p>

<p>They did not know; she lay with closed eyes most
of the time, and they received no replies to queries,
but Ana felt that she only slept fitfully, and then
her own muttered words were certain to arouse her
to a sort of half wakefulness in which she was simply
conscious of the presence of some one without caring
in the least who it was. The entrance of the mob
had not impressed her mind more clearly than the
visionary pictures of the night before.</p>

<p>Old Polonia had again crouched outside the door, in
the hall, wordless as before, and, except for some slight
disarrangement of her clothing, showing less sign than
might have been expected of the horrid scene she had
been a part of. She had gone in to look at her mistress,
had swallowed some wine offered her by Juanita, and
with a short guttural laugh had settled herself outside
the door as a sentinel&mdash;or near enough to hear the
slightest call from Raquel.</p>

<p>The priest regarded her sharply and turned to Ana.</p>

<p>"You are certain it was not Estevan's daughter she
meant to harm?" he asked, quietly, but not so low but
that the sharp ears of the Indian caught the name.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
She pulled a corner of the mantilla from across her eyes
and looked at him.</p>

<p>"Sure," said Ana, "why, she was her nurse, and
the nurse of her mother before her. She would make
a carpet of herself for Raquel's feet."</p>

<p>"The nurse of her mother before her," said the
priest, slowly. "Then she is of that strange hill
tribe of the temple mountain, and she herself is
not a common Indian. To have been nurse to
that family of the priests, means that her own family
was entitled to notice. Yet she has followed, in her
old age, to a strange land. Yes, it must mean devotion.
But why does she dislike the American?"</p>

<p>"God knows! She could not have ever seen him
before. I thought she lied."</p>

<p>"The hate in her eyes was no lie," observed the
padre. "His presence here was lucky, but it is not
explained, any more than is my own. To me it
looks&mdash;well, as I said, he is in with the officers."</p>

<p>"And it is my fault he has seen you&mdash;my fault,"
murmured Ana. "If you would only go at once&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think not; it is a good chance to watch the
gentleman. If I were sure that old woman meant
her hate for him&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stared at Polonia a moment, and then nodded
his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
"I'll take the chance," he decided, and went alone
to her and pulled the cover entirely from her face.</p>

<p>"Friend of a daughter of many kings," he said,
slowly.</p>

<p>She stared at him, and stumbled to her feet in salutation.</p>

<p>"It is true, my father, but the kings of the hills are
dead; and now," pointing toward Raquel, "there will
be no more in the land."</p>

<p>"Who knows?" said the strange padre. "There
still lives a daughter; guard her better than you did
her mother when I carried love messages from
Estevan."</p>

<p>"Ai! I know you now. You have become padre,
and you guard her from the heretics&mdash;the heretics,
father," and she pointed toward the veranda where
Don Enrico and his guest could be heard in conversation.
"That accursed Americano&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sh&mdash;h! quiet, you!" and he placed a hand on her
arm authoritatively; "make no noise, say no words,
but watch him all the time&mdash;every time when I am
out of sight. Understand?"</p>

<p>She glanced from the padre to Ana, who nodded
her head, and at once the dark old face was illuminated;
at last she was not alone in this strange land! Others
were here who hated the Americano, and that made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
them her kindred. She caught the hand of the padre
and pressed it to her forehead.</p>

<p>"I watch always," she promised, fervently; and
to herself she thought, "After all, we get him killed
some way, if the padre, who was a soldier, helps."</p>

<p>They left her in her chosen place, crouched in the
hall just outside the door of Raquel, content at last
that she was not alone in her hatred of the man whom
she blamed for the weary hours of wretchedness lived
through by her mistress.</p>

<p>Ana showed the padre to the room set aside always
for the use of such priests as travelled from San Gabriel
to San Juan. They were not so many of late years,
but in this house they were always honored guests, no
matter what their order, or land, or language.</p>

<p>"I am afraid&mdash;afraid!" said Ana, as she opened the
door; "if some one should come who knows&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No one will," he said, reassuringly, "and this may
be a good chance to learn much. Go, help your aunt,
and forget to fear."</p>

<p>Ana sighed, but went as he bade, to the kitchen,
where Doña Refugia was doing her best to make
amends for the distraction of the cooks. They were
like big, fat, frightened children, not one of them of
any use that night.</p>

<p>Still, there chanced to be enchilladas made the day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
before, and the tortillas took but a little while to bake,
and the bonfire in the yard had settled to a bed of
gleaming coals where the beef could be barbecued with
no delay but the sending of some girls to the creek for
spears of peeled willow. Ana glanced out and saw
them squatted peacefully around the red heap, turning
the poles on which the strips of beef were hung, as
phlegmatic as though they had not howled for a human
roasting there not an hour ago.</p>

<p>Juanita had made the table look very nice, in honor
of the strange American guest who had followed her
call and saved the family from the disgrace of such a
killing.</p>

<p>He filled her girlish ideal of the heroic, and she
was not like some women who thought that California
girls should marry only their own race: a big American
husband seemed the finest thing in the world to
Juanita.</p>

<p>So there were red geraniums on the table, and yellow
poppies, and the best new plates brought from a
steamer at San Pedro but a month before; they were
a bright blue, and Juanita thought the color combination
very fine indeed. She ran to put on a new dress,
that the stranger might not think they all looked as if
the house had been wrecked. Ana, for a wonder, was
indifferent to her own personal appearance, and kept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
on an old black dress with not even a collar of lace to
break its severity.</p>

<p>Don Enrico showed Bryton to a room where he
could wash and brush a bit, but so interested was he in
his chance guest, that he remained at the door chatting
affably, and recounting the word he had received that
day that Flores and his men had made a big fight with
some cattle people over in Sonora, and had either got
a boat at San Onofre and gone out to sea, or else they
were somewhere in the San Juan mountains, and of
course had spies on the outlook for the marshal or the
army men. Don Enrico himself thought it time for
the army men to interfere&mdash;there were many army men
in Los Angeles, and this was no longer a county affair.</p>

<p>"But the devil of a trouble in this country is that
too many Mexican men, and women too, will help to
hide Flores's men because of Capitan, who has never
yet taken a peso from a Mexican, except the Arteagas,
and who never fails to strip an American if he starts
on his trail. They like that, these Mexicans, whose
men fought the Americanos; they are not strong
enough to fight in the open, but they like to help
this vagabond Capitan, who should have been priest
instead of bandit, and who keeps up their fight for
them under cover."</p>

<p>He had entered the dining-room while talking, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
so interested was he in his pet complaint against the
troublesome outlaws, that he did not notice the tall
black figure by the side of his wife.</p>

<p>"Uncle, this is Padre Libertad," said Ana, almost
timidly. Don Enrico did not like priests in general;
he made the mistake of classing them all with the
Catalonian padre of San Juan, whom he disliked so
much that he would not eat at the same table. His
women folks never knew how he would receive a man
of the Church until he was proven to his taste.</p>

<p>However, the good American whiskey had put him
in a cordial mood, and he nodded amiably as he took
his seat.</p>

<p>"A good day to you, padre," he said. "You tramped
a long way in the dust to find trouble, did you? Well,
the women are thanking the saints you came at the
right time, you and Señor Bryton. So it is all very
well, and God send that the fight gave you an appetite."</p>

<p>And evidently something did, for the priest ate like
a vaquero off the ranges. Don Enrico felt a growing
respect for the man who could eat more barbecued meat
than himself, and drink as much red wine. In fact,
all did ample justice to the beef of the bonfire built for
old Polonia,&mdash;all except Ana,&mdash;who still looked pale
and uneasy, and Bryton, who made a pretence of eating,
but who refused a second glass of wine, a thing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
the padre noticed with a smile, and their host commented
on vigorously.</p>

<p>"You can't drink&mdash;you Americans," he insisted;
"and look at your plate,&mdash;not half empty! It takes
students and brain-workers like the padre and me
to spoil a side of beef! You are Spanish and of
Mexico, padre?"</p>

<p>"No, not even my grandfather came from Spain; so
I cannot claim to be Spanish," said the padre. "I
claim only to be Mexican."</p>

<p>"And good enough too! Across the line, do these
bandits of ours make much trouble these days?"</p>

<p>"No one has complained to me of them. You
say they take most from the Americano, but in our
country there are no Americano ranches yet; we do
not expect to find them there for many years."</p>

<p>"Well, Capitan does go down there sometimes,"
insisted Don Enrico; "I've heard of it. His family
meant him for the Church, but the young devil ran
away and joined the army with his elder brother.
The Americans shot Roberto; this one was only a
boy then, light-weight to ride, and he carried despatches,
and never went back to the Church. Oh,
he is Californian, all right,&mdash;is cousin to half the
country. He is&mdash;what relation should he be to us,
Refugia?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
"He is second cousin to me," said Ana.</p>

<p>"So if you hear of him being in trouble for his soul,
say a prayer for him, padre, on account of his loyal
cousin," said Juanita, and laughed teasingly; but Ana
lifted troubled, dark eyes to the padre's face.</p>

<p>"Do so, father," she said, simply; "for the sake
of his soul, remember me!"</p>

<p>"These women!" laughed her uncle; "they are
always troubling us about our souls, padre. Don't
let them spoil your supper with a list of prayers!"</p>

<p>"And what would become of some of your souls if
we women did not say the prayers?" retorted his
wife. "God knows, Capitan needs them."</p>

<p>"We all need them," said the priest, quietly.</p>

<p>"Still, I always have understood that he is the
whitest of the bunch," observed Bryton.</p>

<p>"There are, then, different shades of blackness?"
asked the padre. "I believe the law holds all equally
guilty."</p>

<p>"El Capitan's motives, at least, have been different,
and it has come to be understood that when
extremely brutal things have occurred on their raids,
Capitan is never of the party."</p>

<p>"Is it so? I did not know you Americanos gave
Mexicans credit for such negative virtues?"</p>

<p>Bryton looked up quickly. There was a mocking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
light in the eyes of the padre, and he was smiling
across the table. The smile puzzled Bryton as much
as the quick alarm in the eyes of Ana. Was she
afraid of controversy over the still warm question of
Mexican and United States rights?</p>

<p>"I think that, individually, we give each other
credit," he replied, "especially to the fighters. It is
only the political schemers who make the troubles
between the two factions. As for Capitan, he has too
much daring not to force admiration even from the
people he dislikes."</p>

<p>Ana flashed a grateful glance at him, and a slight
flush crept to the forehead of the padre; he gulped
down the contents of his glass, and pushed back his
chair.</p>

<p>"Do you fear any trouble with those Indians
to-night?" he asked, abruptly. "Had I better speak
with them?"</p>

<p>"It is better, perhaps, that we say a rosary, and
bring them together that way," observed Doña
Refugia; "it is the best way. I will have Pedro ring
the bell&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ana slipped out of the dining-room beside the padre.</p>

<p>"You will?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Surely; a rosary is easy. Why do you look so
frightened? Your Americano will not eat me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
"But you don't like him?"</p>

<p>"What does that matter? At least, he says no
harm of a man behind his back, and it is true what he
says of the politicians. Oh, if he keeps up the compliments,
who knows but that we may be good friends
yet&mdash;after he has paid for the horses he took
north? Chut!&mdash;that is only jest! Smile a little and
help to corral the Indians."</p>

<p>Bryton, with Juanita beside him, had sauntered
again to the veranda. Passing the door of the hall,
he noticed Polonia still crouched there, and Juanita
shuddered and drew away.</p>

<p>"I am always frightened at her," she confessed;
"not alone would I go in a room where she is at dark
for all the gold they say there is in Trabuco Mountain.
It is not so strange to me that the poor
creatures were afraid and thought her a witch. If
you had heard the Doña Raquel all last night, you
also would have thought only witchcraft could make
her so suddenly fall sick with a heart-ache for a ring
that would save her, and a temple where a sacrifice
was. Truly, it was pitiful&mdash;her cries. I pulled the
pillow over my ears. Only Ana was brave enough to
stay close to her,&mdash;Ana and the old mummy."</p>

<p>"And Doña Ana&mdash;she thought what of it all&mdash;the
madness&mdash;the&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
"Oh, Ana has no love for Rafael; she blames
him in some way; and it may be that he does make
trouble for his wife&mdash;he would not be an Arteaga
else. But she never mentioned his name in all her
cries, never once. She called always&mdash;always for the
ring, and laughed that some one who wore the ring
was again alive. Oh, it was all of queer crazy things
like that&mdash;ghostly things&mdash;she made laments for.
It was like purgatory to hear her, yet Ana was not
afraid. She has courage, that girl!"</p>

<p>"She is asleep now?" he asked, suddenly.</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;Ana? why&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, I mean Doña&mdash;I mean the sick lady.
She is better&mdash;or&mdash;how?"</p>

<p>"She notices nothing, and says nothing, but she
does not scream for some one who was dead and is
now alive, as she did last night, when she laughed
and wept; so I think that means the herb teas have
checked the fever. Do not you?"</p>

<p>Just then the bell rang in the patio for the rosary,
and Juanita, with a word of apology, slipped away,
saying diffidently, "Though you are welcome to come
and pray with us,"&mdash;divided between her wish to have
him, and her reluctance to make it obligatory on a
heretical guest to attend their services.</p>

<p>"I shall pray with you," he said, simply, "but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
I shall remain here. My presence might not have
a soothing effect on your servants. I shall smoke a
cigar here on the terrace until you return."</p>

<p>Juanita blushed. She would rather have lingered
there herself than joined the others. The dusk was
coming on; a few last bars of red lay along the sky
line to the west where the sea was, and at that hour
there was no corner so delightfully appealing as the
great veranda where the gold-of-Ophir roses made
a lattice of green and yellow against the warm sky.</p>

<p>Ana entered and lit a candle in the hall and another
in the room of Raquel, and went out again with a quiet
nod to the American guest pacing the veranda aimlessly,
and smoking one of Don Enrico's prime cigarros.</p>

<p>When she had disappeared, he sauntered as aimlessly
through the hall to the patio where the dark
people were gathered with bent heads, murmuring
responses sullenly, scarcely daring to lift their eyes
to the group on the veranda.</p>

<p>A few candles had been lit along the wall where
the shadows were deepening, and in their soft light
Bryton could see Don Enrico and all the men of
the ranch&mdash;vaqueros and ploughmen alike&mdash;kneeling
back of the women, and the red light yet showing
through the gray of the ashes where the flames had
leaped so lately.</p>

<p>Only an instant he gave to it all,
but in that instant he made certain
that every man and woman
on the place was at prayers,
except the old Indian woman,
who squatted with covered head
in the hall, and himself. His
movements were no longer aimless. He retreated
swiftly to the veranda, and tossed the cigarro into
the garden. One glance he gave the wooden-like
figure of the old Indian. Only as a last resort would
he attempt to pass that way, but if the windows
were not barred&mdash;</p>

<p>They were not. Ana had gone against her aunt's
Mexican rule, which was that all fresh air should
be excluded from a sick-room; and while that lady
and all her servants exclaimed against the admission
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
of air, they let the blame lie on the shoulders of Ana,
and no one closed the window. It swung wide to the
wind of the west, and on the couch within, Bryton
could see Raquel's face.</p>

<p>The lids were closed over the violet eyes, and the
lips were apart, showing the white teeth. It was still
so light that he could see the little flush on the cheeks
against the white pillow, and on her right hand one
little old ring of plain gold. On the left hand shone
the red gold of her new wedding-ring.</p>

<p>She looked so pathetically young and so utterly
alone, as she lay there, that all the man in him arose
in protest, and a mist of tears blinded him for a
moment to the beauty of her face.</p>

<p>"Poor little one," he whispered, "my poor little
broken Doña Espiritu&mdash;my one lady of the spirit!"</p>

<p>The sound of the words did not wake her, but
the sense of them reached her some way; for she
opened her eyes suddenly, and without any shadow
of wonder they rested on his face.</p>

<p>"I waited a long time," she said at last, "then I
heard your voice, and I knew you were coming
to me."</p>

<p>He set his lips tightly, and nodded, but did
not speak.</p>

<p>"I waited a long time," she repeated, as a child
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
appealing for understanding. "Did they tell you
I thought you were dead?"</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a href='images/p240p.jpg'>
	<img src='images/p240w.jpg'
	title='Then I Heard Your Voice' alt='Then I Heard Your Voice' />
</a>
<p>&ldquo;Then I Heard Your Voice&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>He nodded assent. No one had told him so, but
the words explained much.</p>

<p>"You said you would come back if you lived,
and you never came, and they told me&mdash;the padre
told me&mdash;that you were dead!"</p>

<p>"So I am," he said, gently; "and they told me,
my lady of the spirit, that you had taken the final
vow of the convent&mdash;that the night, our one night,
was a thing you were forgetting under a black veil.
Child, child! they lied to us, and now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Forgetting?" she said, slowly. "How does one
forget a night like that, when we walked out of the
wilderness into the day together? You never came
back; and I&mdash;I wanted to be in the world where
you had been, so I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," he whispered, gently; "I know, my
doña of the spirit."</p>

<p>He had not meant to touch her,&mdash;only to look
at her and speak to her once, and then ride wherever
fate might take him.</p>

<p>But she reached her hands to him, and with a
smothered groan he knelt by her couch and his arms
were around her.</p>

<p>"Don't weep like that!" she whispered, and laid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
her hand on his head. "I have wept enough for two,
since our carriages passed and I found you had not
died. And you&mdash;you knew all the time."</p>

<p>"I knew when I saw you kneel in your wedding-veil
and take that oath&mdash;not until then. I heard his
mother say that he was the man you loved; and, soul
of mine! you had not said as much as that in words
to me. So I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You heard that? Then you know the life I have
to live." He nodded, without lifting his head from
the pillow of her arm. There are some things hard to
face with open eyes, but she felt the shudder that
passed over him. Through the opened window came
the rise and fall of many murmuring voices repeating
the rosary. In the gold-of-Ophir rose-tree two birds
fluttered and called to each other in the very whisper
of bird notes. The soft lavender-grays of a Californian
nightfall were sifting through the warm light of
the afterglow, and away there in the west stretched bars
of blood red, the last trace of the dying day. All the
sequestration of the hour was about them, all the hush
of the pause, before the final plunge of their day into
the shadows, and the two souls were enveloped by
the atmosphere of that ever-recurring tragedy of the
hours, and of lives.</p>

<p>How long he knelt there he did not know. She felt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
his lips on her wrist, and felt rather than heard the
broken words he was whispering&mdash;the wild, mad words
he had meant not to say, as he had meant not to touch
her; then her eyes grew bright as the stars picking their
way through the vault of blue, and the golden-haired
woman of the carriage belonged to a feverish phantasy
of the past hours. She might exist, that golden-haired
creature of beauty, but the real life of the man who
knelt there in the dusk belonged only to her, to her always,
through the bond of one starlit Mexican night
of witchery, and this last hour of the California day.</p>

<p>Nothing made any difference now; though she lived
in a hell of purgatory all her waking life, the bonds of
their dream life would be closer than all else&mdash;always,
always!</p>

<p>She felt suddenly well and strong. Ah, there was
so much in the world to live for! Though they never
met, never spoke again, this hour of the tryst would
be his through all her life&mdash;her hour of a rosary of
the heart.</p>

<p>A girl's voice in the patio came softly through the
dark in an old Spanish hymn. It was Juanita, and the
service of prayer was ending in the usual duo; one of
the vaqueros with a fine barytone voice was singing
the echoing stanzas of praise.</p>

<p>It was the signal for dispersing, but the man at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
couch did not know that. Neither did he know that
the crouched form of the Indian was no longer in
the hall. She was waiting in the dusk at the door,
and she was clutching with a claw-like hand at the
robe of the padre, and muttering, "He is there&mdash;it
is true. He is there&mdash;and she is again bewitched.
Now you will help me to kill the American?"</p>

<p>The padre looked at her sharply, and then motioned
to Ana, who was close behind.</p>

<p>"Remain with the others. Make some excuse to
keep them there&mdash;another hymn&mdash;anything. And
be quick&mdash;quick!"</p>

<p>Startled though she was, Ana obeyed, and from the
door of the hall he heard again the voice of Juanita;
this time it was in a favorite known to all, and the volume
of sound told him that Don Enrico himself was
joining in the refrain, and that no one would leave the
patio until the finale was reached.</p>

<p>No candle burned now in the hall. Polonia had
blown it out, that no ray might enter the half-open
door of the inner room. She would have gone with
the padre, but the sudden vigorous grasp of his hand
on her shoulder stopped her where she stood, and
without a word being spoken, she knew better than
to follow.</p>

<p>Quickly as a cat of the hills, the padre crossed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
hall and stood where he could see the open window
and the kneeling man, and the hand of Raquel on his
bent head.</p>

<p>"Every night when the dusk comes it will be our
time of the day," she was saying. "They told me
you were dead, else&mdash;but you know. I think the
mad hours have gone by for me; I can go on living
if&mdash;if you do not forget."</p>

<p>The listening priest could not hear what the man
said, but she heard, and smiled, and sighed.</p>

<p>"There is one thing," she said, hesitatingly: "the
ring, you have worn it a year&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," and he lifted his head. "We need no
visible emblem, you and I. I put it back on your finger,
my lady of the spirit,&mdash;Doña Espiritu;&mdash;a pledge of
renunciation, and a reminder of the rosary of the dusk."</p>

<p>She took from her right hand the little gold band
and gave it to him, and in its place he slipped the
onyx ring of the Aztec eagle and serpent.</p>

<p>"I did not tell you what that ring means to my people,"
she said, as he kissed it in its new resting-place.
"Maybe I never can tell you. I&mdash;I thought I could
be stronger if I wore it on my own hand, for&mdash;for the
reason that my heart went out of my bosom to follow
it, and&mdash;and I rode my horse as fast and as far as I
could from you, because I&mdash;was afraid."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
"Good God!" whispered the man. "You don't
know what you are saying. Remember that I dare
not touch your lips, and that I love you&mdash;love you&mdash;love
you!"</p>

<p>Then the nestling birds in the gold-of-Ophir rose
were startled from their repose by the man who
strode through the open window and walked blindly
out into the garden.</p>

<p>The padre watched the girl's face on the pillow for
a moment, and heard her sobs, and retreated softly to
the hall, where he met the others; and at Doña Ana,
when they were alone a moment, he smiled with a
certain elation.</p>

<p>"Look distressed no longer, little one," he said,
reassuringly. "You have helped me to a good day's
work, very good. Listen! I like your new American
friend very much, and when you go to San Juan I
count on you to help to make him welcome there.
He is going to do me a good turn with Rafael
Arteaga, and I forgive him all the horses he helped
to save for the army men. He does not know it,
but he is going to be my good friend, that fine
Americano. He is so fine and so strong, Ana, that
he thinks he can put a woman he loves in a niche of
the memory, as we put statues of the saints in the
niches of the altar-places."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
"What do you say?" she queried, perplexed by his
smile and words.</p>

<p>"And that though the woman loves him so much
that she kisses her own hands where his lips have
been, and though he loves her so much that he is half
mad at denial, yet he will leave her always there in
the little niche of the altar,&mdash;just above his head, but
in reach of his hands; and the hands will never try to
lift her down, Anita. He will only look at her as he
rides past, and leave her there to remember."</p>

<p>"I think you have gone mad," said Ana, sharply.
"What did the Indian witch tell you in the hall?"</p>

<p>"Ask her!" he suggested. But when Ana did so,
she met only scowls and gutturals. And even the
sound sleep of Raquel, and the absolute freedom from
delirium, brought nothing but suspicion to the heart
of old Polonia. It was witchcraft, like all the rest,
and the padre should have put the malediction on the
Americano when he had so good a chance. Above
all, he should not have let him ride away in safety.</p>

<p>The padre himself rode away
very early. Don Enrico lent
him a horse to ride to San Juan,
and wondered a little that the
San Gabriel people had not
done as much; but times were
changing in the land. One
could not expect the old customs to live when so
many strangers were crowding into the country.</p>

<p>The offered horse was accepted gratefully, and the
padre breakfasted with the vaqueros, and left for the
south before the family were astir. Bryton watched
him go, but lingered for a sight of Ana, that he might
hear how the night had passed inside the window of
the golden rose.</p>

<p>And Ana was the last to join the party at breakfast,
but was a very happy creature, compared with the
nervous, pale woman of the night before. All were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
astonished at the fact that Raquel announced that she
had slept like a child and all the illness and fever were
forgotten. She was not sure but that she could ride
to San Juan, and above all things she was grateful to
Ana, and wished both the girls to go with her and
visit in the old Mission.</p>

<p>The servants were again the quiet listless folk they
had been before the finding of the witch charm. But
as Bryton rode out of the patio after many farewells
and blessings from Doña Refugia, and cordial invitations
from Don Enrico to ride back that way, and
consider the place as his own home, there were sullen
scowls among the dark people.</p>

<p>On the veranda Juanita stood alone and waved an
adios to him. Back of her was the open window of the
golden rose, and a slender girlish figure swayed toward
him for an instant and then stood erect, and their eyes
met and lingered, while he swept his sombrero to the
stirrup.</p>

<p>Juanita wondered, since he saluted so gallantly and
rode with his face turned toward her veranda until the
hedge intervened, why he did not smile; she was
accustomed to gayer caballeros. She realized that she
must have looked very pretty in her pink gown
framed in the blossoming vines, and she turned away
with a pout and a shrug. After all, Fernando was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
right: American men did not know how to make
love.</p>

<p>Raquel was rather pale and very quiet that morning,
but insisted upon staying up; she even remembered
to ask what the loud calling and running of many feet
had meant the evening before; or had she dreamed it?
She supposed it was a stampede of horses&mdash;was
it? Was any one hurt? She had heard the voices
of women.</p>

<p>Ana told her it was only the breaking loose of part
of a wild herd, but that no one was injured. Old
Polonia heard, and blinked and scowled at Ana, but
said nothing.</p>

<p>It was noon when Rafael reached the ranch and
caught sight of Raquel in a porch-chair under the
vines. She paled slightly at sight of him, and turned
the onyx ring so that the carving did not show, and
by the time he had crossed the patio and walked to
join them, her face was a serene mask. The only
surprise she betrayed was at the dark look he cast on
Ana.</p>

<p>"Are you two in a politician's pay, that you bring
me from Los Angeles in a fright of life and death,
when I am needed every minute there for the business
matters?" he demanded, and saw in a moment
that his wife did not understand. Ana only laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
"I did it," she acknowledged. "I sent the boy
with some truths for you. Your wife was like to die
the first night she came. It is by the grace of God
she has been saved from a siege of fever. She does
not know in the least how ill she was, but if you had
heard her gabbling of blood-stained altars and strange
wedding-rings, and floods sweeping over her until she
screamed to be saved from them,&mdash;well, Don Rafael,
you might well have forgotten to spare your horse.
Three hours would have brought a lover here, but it
takes thirty for the husband."</p>

<p>"Why do you two quarrel always?" asked Raquel,
indifferently. "I did not know she had sent for you.
I was very tired, and the hot sun&mdash;something&mdash;oh
yes, I was ill, and wakened myself screaming. But it
is all gone. I can go home."</p>

<p>Rafael tramped the veranda and sulked.</p>

<p>"A fine laugh you have made for me in Los Angeles!
They will think you were sick, that I follow
my wife!" he said, frowning at Ana. "God of my
soul! Why do you not get another husband to
worry into the grave, and let your neighbors alone?"</p>

<p>She only laughed again, and bent over her embroidery
frame, where white butterflies were being
woven on the drawn threads of linen.</p>

<p>"Because no fine, manly, handsome caballero like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
yourself rides this way to ask me," she retorted.
"All the most desirable men are always married."</p>

<p>"The Señor Bryton was here for the night," remarked
Juanita.</p>

<p>"Oh, he was? Alone?" asked Rafael.</p>

<p>Juanita nodded. "And a priest," she added.
"They both rode south."</p>

<p>"Bryton alone?" mused Rafael. "I thought perhaps&mdash;Did
any strangers ride south last night,&mdash;a
large party?"</p>

<p>No one had heard of any one passing.</p>

<p>"Doña Maria comes in a carriage by this morning,"
he remarked, "and Mrs. Bryton. I suppose
they will want you to travel in their carriage, if you
feel equal to the drive to San Juan."</p>

<p>"Oh, she must not go to-day&mdash;not for anything!"
decided Doña Refugia, who had come from the hall
and overheard. "Doña Maria and her friend can
stop here a few days, and then perhaps if your wife is
strong enough&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Certainly, that is the best, the very best," assented
Rafael, with a smile of relief. Doña Refugia
was making it necessary that Raquel should at least
meet the friends of Doña Maria. All was turning
out well, after all.</p>

<p>Raquel made no remark, only looked out idly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
across the garden to the fields, yellow where the mustard
bloom glowed. She knew she could not bear it
just yet. Later, perhaps, she could grow strong
enough to see Bryton's wife, and hear her voice cut
across the days and the dusks here, where his whispers
had awakened her to life&mdash;some day, perhaps;
but she knew it could not be either to-day or to-morrow.</p>

<p>Her husband watched her curiously. If she would
only give some sign of what she felt, as another
woman would do! How was a man to read a woman
who stared out on life like a sphinx, seeing nothing
and hearing nothing?</p>

<p>In the same way, she had seemed a bit of wood
over that old legend of the curse on San Juan: it had
not changed in the least her determination to go back
there; yet, since she had screamed of it in a fever,
who was to know what feeling it had awakened back
of those fathomless violet eyes?</p>

<p>Rafael turned this theory over in his mind, and
smoked several cigarros to help to solve the problem,
but it was of no use. It had been a very fine marriage
for him. Her visit to Los Angeles had further
emphasized that fact; but he had the galling feeling of
being only prince-consort to the queen, and it was not
so pleasant to a man who had been shown favor of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
different sort by many women who would have been
glad to give him the king's place.</p>

<p>To marry a girl who is like a wooden saint in a
church may be a victory; it may be even romantic
when she is half a nun; but it is not comforting to
a husband who expects only a wife, a home.</p>

<p>Then across his thoughts came the blue eyes and
yellow hair of the woman he had said a reluctant
good-bye to in Los Angeles. There was a woman
who would have met all his friends half-way, would
have promoted his interests, instead of closing doors
and refusing to entertain any but the slow old Spanish,
who were letting all the money slip out of their
hands. In a few years their names would be forgotten
in the new world of commerce building, through
the Americanos in Los Angeles,&mdash;the Americanos
whom his wife disdained, but whom the clever little
woman of the blue eyes would have won to his interests
in so many ways that her influence would have
weighed down all the gold of the Estevan heiress,
who did not know how to use it. It is only a trick
of fate that the money always goes to the wrong people.</p>

<p>So he thought, and smoked, and looked at Raquel
Estevan de Arteaga, and wondered by what man&oelig;vre
or stratagem he could break down her prejudices;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
he wondered, also, how a woman with such eyes and
such lips could be so cold. He supposed it was inherited
from the nun, her mother.</p>

<p>Rafael had never heard the story of the love, and
revenge, and widowhood of that nun. One or two of
the older people of San Juan had heard of it at the
time of Estevan's death, but none knew how true it
was. It seemed too much a bit out of the dark ages
of the Indian records to be true of the debonair
Felipe, who had ridden and fought to the admiration
of all Californian Mexico, who had found women
wherever he rode, and had made love as a caballero's
duty. It seemed scarcely credible that he, of all men,
should have met death in that way on the far southern
mountain; and the older men crossed themselves and
tried to forget it, and the younger ones never heard
of it.</p>

<p>Rafael, smoking on the veranda and watching the
serene face of his wife, and ascribing her coldness to
the chill of convent walls, understood her no more
than had Felipe Estevan understood the nun who had
stepped down from her saint's niche for him; and old
Polonia, sitting in the shadow, watched them both,
and in her dull brain was also a query: Would he
ever discover that she was not cold? And would
he find out in the same way? Both God and the devil
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
would be needed to help them all on that day, for
California was not the hill of the temple, where the
Indian still ruled!</p>

<p>Rafael at last rode out to the range to see Don
Enrico about several matters. He did not care to
alarm the women concerning the rumors of the bandits,
but now, since he had left Los Angeles behind, he
would just as soon ride with the vigilantes as not, and
Don Enrico could be trusted. It would be five long
hours before the carriage with Doña Maria and her
bewitching guest reached the ranch, and one must kill
time some way.</p>

<p>He killed more time than he had counted upon.
As the sun began to lower, and he and Don Enrico
turned their horses for the ranch-house, the dogs
started a coyote, and with one accord the Don, his
guest, and his vaqueros, took up the trail, following
the howls with hue and cry over mesa and along
creeks, and by the time the dark had fallen, they were
far toward Trabuco. They rode back laughing and
singing, and making little dashes at racing, under the
early stars.</p>

<p>But their laughter was changed when they rode into
the corral. News had come from the south, and a
bad thing had happened there. The sheriff from Los
Angeles had been ambushed by the Flores men at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
Niguel Rancho, and nine men were lying dead there.
Carts were on the way to take them to San Juan for
Christian burial, and Bryton had sent a messenger to
Los Angeles with the word; the man had only checked
his horse at San Joaquin ranch to shout out the news;
that was hours ago. The Indian who had searched
the ranges for Don Enrico had come back and said
he was not to be found. Doña Refugia had thought
it possible that they had heard the word on the ranges
and ridden direct to San Juan, and thanked God they
had not done so.</p>

<p>She went on to recount to Rafael her terror of the
night before, and the awful scene from which she had
by no means recovered, and now for this horror to
follow so close, and the dread that they might be left
alone on the ranch&mdash;well, she was having chills at
the thought. Ana was the only one not afraid, but
with Ana gone to San Juan Capistrano&mdash;</p>

<p>Rafael grasped her arm so tightly that she gasped.</p>

<p>"To San Juan?" he demanded. "Alone?" But
he was certain of the answer before she spoke.</p>

<p>"Holy Maria! What a grip you have! No. Did
I not tell you? Well, we are crazy over it all; we
forget. No; she went with your wife, and wild horses
could not have held either one of them."</p>

<p>"A malediction on the pair of them!" burst out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Rafael. "God curse the horses they ride, that they
break their necks on the way!"</p>

<p>"Rafael, for Jesus' sake, not so loud!" and Doña
Refugia tried to put her hand over his mouth, but he
dashed it aside in fury.</p>

<p>"Loud! Holy God! What do I care?" he demanded,
wrathfully. "Do you know why they go
like that? It is all a lie, that ambush story. That
devil Ana Mendez has schemed to have some one
ride past and call that out to you, so that they could
pretend an excuse to ride anywhere away from here;
and do you know why?"</p>

<p>Doña Refugia was past speech, and could only
shake her head dumbly.</p>

<p>"Well, I will tell you. It is because Raquel
Estevan did not mean to meet the friends you said
you would be pleased to entertain on their arrival
from Los Angeles. Doña Maria she will speak to,
but Doña Angela is one of the heretics she vows her
doors will not open to. That is the reason."</p>

<p>"But, Rafael&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now listen to me," and he turned his fierce stride
across the hall, "and God curse me if I do not keep
my word!"</p>

<p>"Rafael!" she gasped, frightened at the white fury
of his face; but he held up his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
"I swear she shall open her door to admit the
women she slighted, first at Los Angeles and again
in your home. She will find she has an Arteaga for a
master. She shall open her door; she shall receive
her; she shall make up for the insult to your home.
By God, she shall make up, with interest!"</p>

<p>Then he strode out of the door, leaving Doña
Refugia in a cold terror lest the guest of whom he
spoke had heard his words through the closed door
of Ana's room. It had been given to Mrs. Bryton
on the arrival of the party an hour before, and though
the door was closed, who could tell that his words
might not have been heard there?</p>

<p>But the window on the veranda was open, and
Doña Refugia breathed a sigh of relief when, a few
minutes later, she saw Mrs. Bryton's fair face emerge
from a bower of clematis in the garden. She had
been admiring the beauty of the lilies out there, and
looked like one herself,&mdash;so cool, so sweetly childish
in her little appeals for admiration of the beautiful
blooms she loved. Rafael met her there, and was
enslaved anew by the blue eyes, as he bent over her
tiny hand and kissed it furtively, and walked with her
to show her Doña Refugia's carnation-beds, and
under the starlight help her to see the beauties of
the San Joaquin garden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
But old Polonia, who had heard his words to Doña
Refugia, and who watched the two walking in the
starlight, muttered in her Indian jargon, "Have a
care, Don Rafael; have a care!"</p>

<p>Despite Rafael's doubt, it was all true about the
ambush. It was quite true, and very awful. It had
occurred in the morning, and Bryton had missed it
only by his stay that night at the ranch. But he was
also quite right when he said the two girls had left
the ranch for other reasons. Raquel was quietly preparing
to leave, when the word came warranting her
in taking Ana. The two rode south with few words,
each so wrapped in her own reasons for going that she
gave no thought to the reasons of the other.</p>

<p>They found the town panic-stricken. Don Juan
Alvara was ill, and Padre Andros absent at San Luis
Rey. Raquel rode into the plaza white and weak
from the long ride, but sat erect to hear of the things
done and the things needed for the dead.</p>

<p>It was almost dark. While Ysadora the cook prepared
supper, Ana questioned concerning a padre who
had ridden a San Joaquin horse to San Juan that
morning, but no one had seen him. Later, the animal
was found grazing along Trabuco Creek. Evidently,
some one had passed with a wagon or a herd going
south, and had given the padre help on the way;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
beyond that, no one thought, except Ana, and what
she thought she did not say.</p>

<p>Raquel walked through the little hall of the
Mission into what had once been the garden of the
padres, the little enclosed bit at the back of the belfry
built after the falling of the tower. It was the one
little corner from which the world seemed shut out.
Under the carved doorway she passed into the old
domed vestry with its stone centre cut, or worn
by the dripping water, into the semblance of a leering
face; "the devil's face," it was called, and people
looked from its queer smile to the twisted serpent-like
carving over what had once been the arch to the
church itself, and wondered what the strange carvings
meant, and found no one to answer. They were
only a sign left by an unknown Mexican sculptor a
half-century ago.</p>

<p>Raquel glanced at them and shuddered, and passed
out into the great unroofed, beautiful place of fluted
pillars and carven cornices.</p>

<p>The pink reflection of the sunset yet lingered on
the mesa and the highlands above the sea. The
world of the strange new town to the north was left
behind. Here among the ruins consecrated, she
breathed the air of home-coming, and paced the old
altar-place with noiseless step, and with closed eyes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
and hands clasped she murmured prayers not in the
book, taught by the good nuns; and she drew great
breaths of strength from the wine-like air, and
knew that somewhere, riding the mesa, a man was
remembering this hour of the rosary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here among the Ruins Consecrated&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Ana found her later on the altar steps, with
head bowed over her knees. Gaining no reply to
questions, Ana felt that she had been weeping. She
undressed her and put her to bed in the little chamber
of the barred window facing the sea, and gave her all
the care a devoted friend could in the grim isolation
of the old walls.</p>

<p>And that was the home-coming of Raquel after her
half-royal reception in the City of the Angels.</p>

<p>When Andres Pico and his men
rode into San Juan with the
doubtful decoration of necklaces
of human ears strung on rawhide
strings, there was a breath
of relief from the natives: it
meant that the bandits had been
"confessed," according to the General's naive explanation
of the absence of prisoners they knew he had
taken; the backbone of the bandit gang was broken.</p>

<p>The vigilantes were the heroes of the hour. As
the band of outlaws divided and fled in various directions,
they were waited for at every pass and hewn
down by the dozen. Only two&mdash;Fontez, who had
shot the sheriff, and El Capitan, who had not been
seen by any one at any time of the raid&mdash;were still
missing. One of the prisoners, on being questioned,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
stated that Fontez had taken his share of the plunder
and started for Lower California; and when questioned
as to El Capitan, swore wrathfully, because El Capitan
had disagreed with Flores over the raid, refused to be
counted in, and in consequence they would all go to
hell! If El Capitan had helped, things would have
been different, very different. He had voted against
starting out with fifty men to drive the gringos from
Southern California; he had fought them before in the
open, and knew them. He had told Flores he was a
fool, and left them in Santiago Cañon, and ridden
away, and after the slaughter of the sheriff and his
men he had ridden out of the mustard on a horse of
the San Joaquin brand, and told them to ride south
and stop for nothing; and no one had seen him since.
They had not taken his advice&mdash;and now it was all
over! A little later, it certainly was over for that particular
unfortunate, and his ears were added to a string
decorating a swarthy ranchman, who was especially
lionized because of his gruesome trophies.</p>

<p>In the plaza of San Juan Mission, Ana listened to
the hero of the necklace reciting all the glories of the
campaign, and shuddered at the ghastly witness of its
veracity. Raquel, standing beside her horse, listened
also and felt a loathing of it all. Regular war, such
as she had heard of, had never appeared so awful as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
this series of slaughters from ambush, where the victors
of either side decked themselves like savages.</p>

<p>"It is bad that we have no soldiers left who are
hidalgos," she remarked. "The wild Indians carry
scalps at their belts; I did not know people did so
who had learned their religion from the padres."</p>

<p>She mounted and rode toward the sea, the only
woman who dared venture alone out of sight of the
protecting walls of the Mission in those days. The
man with the necklace looked after her, and then up at
the line of grain-sacks still left as a barricade along
the roofs of the corridor. Behind them, men with
rifles had lain through the days and nights when the
panic was at its worst, and women and children had
huddled in dread of massacre in the inner court.</p>

<p>"Does the señora forget all that," he asked, "or is
there a caballero to guard her where she rides?"</p>

<p>Ana turned on the hero, glad of an outlet for her
pent-up anger. "You&mdash;you butcher!" she said between
her little white teeth. "You know Rafael
Arteaga is not here. What other man would ride
with his wife?"</p>

<p>"Who knows?" he laughed, easily. "The lady is
not afraid, that is clear; and El Capitan is somewhere
in the hills, or the willows."</p>

<p>She said nothing, realizing that he was watching her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
closely, for all his apparent carelessness. When she
continued silent, he laughed and swept his sombrero
to the ground and sauntered away. She knew then
that he had simply tried her, to see if by any chance
she showed knowledge of, or fear for, the outlaw she
had never disowned as cousin.</p>

<p>Teresa, seated beside her, saw her changing color,
and reached over, patting her hand.</p>

<p>"Even when thou wert little the Capitan made a
pet of thee," she said, kindly; "and now every friend
he ever had is being watched. If&mdash;if&mdash;in any way
you could warn him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Warn him? How can we, when no one
knows? I would walk barefoot across San Juan
Mountain if I knew where he was hidden. He may
be dying, or dead."</p>

<p>"That is so," decided Teresa, placidly; "and it
would be better. They will always hunt him if he is
alive."</p>

<p>There was silence between them for a little while,
and then she added, "Well, there will be no mourning
for him in the Arteaga family. Rafael will be glad."</p>

<p>"Oh, he!" muttered Ana, with impatience. "He
is hanging on the skirts of Doña Maria these days,
when he should be here with these other fine gentlemen."
She pointed to the plaza where the vigilantes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
and their friends were gathered preparatory to starting
on a new trail suggested by an Indian who had seen a
white man without a horse somewhere in the hills.</p>

<p>"On the skirts of Doña Maria," repeated Teresa,
her little eyes twinkling with interest. "It is true,
then&mdash;it is that English woman still?"</p>

<p>"Still? How you talk! Is it so long since Los
Angeles?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it was long, long before that! I was&mdash;Santa
Maria!&mdash;I had a fright for a while! I thought there
would be no wedding. He was crazy as a boy over
her. It started, oh, with only a pin-point of a chance;
for the Americano Bryton was here, and her eyes were
for him! And then&mdash;Basta! All at once things
changed, and Doña Angela and Don Rafael were never
apart; and if she had not been married, I think always
Raquel Estevan would have had no husband here in
San Juan Capistrano."</p>

<p>"Raquel&mdash;does she know?"</p>

<p>"Raquel Estevan is too proud to show if she knows,
just as she is now! Never will she go along or follow
him when he rides abroad, but if she knew his time
was with that heretic&mdash;she hates the heretics!"</p>

<p>"She is patient with him."</p>

<p>"Oh, sure; she is a good wife. But if she cared
more, would she do as she did when the girl Marta
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
came to the Mission with her child? On my soul, I
think Rafael was afraid when she gave to Marta the
bed and the clothes, and counted out how many
cattle she could have,&mdash;to say no word as to how
she stood herself as godmother at the baptism! The
padre laughs over that!"</p>

<p>"And Rafael&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Rafael&mdash;God knows what he said to her! He
tried to make her send some one else as godmother, and
she would not. Ysadora heard her say 'It is for your
soul's sake, and the souls of your children, Rafael,'
and he turned white and walked away."</p>

<p>"Poor Rafael," mocked Ana, "I do not think that
he has much of a soul. It is as when a man sees
he is beloved for his bravery, and all the time he
is afraid of his own shadow, and hopes the one who
loves him will not discover his weakness: that is
how Rafael feels when his wife does penance, and
prays for the soul he has not."</p>

<p>"How you talk! We have all a soul; the padre
says so."</p>

<p>"Oh, the padre! The soul of our padre is also
like a grain of mustard seed&mdash;so small, and no soil
to grow in! Never could I confess to him. I wait
until Padre Sanchez comes; no one but a Franciscan
priest do I believe in."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
"Ai! and if you should get sick and die, and Padre
Sanchez on some other side of the world? He is
always travelling; never will he settle and gather
'dobe dollars like our padre. Suppose he should not
come; you would die without confession?"</p>

<p>"No; I would hang on to the edge of life by some
thread of prayer until he came."</p>

<p>"Padre Pedro of the north was here last month:
that man makes me afraid. He tries to be a saint,
and is so often under vows. This time it was a vow
not to speak, and Padre Andros was glad when he
took to the road. It was like a black ghost to see
him walk the plaza with a black hood over his head,
and never a word or look up from the ground.
You would think the saints he prayed to lived somewhere
in the roads. We thanked God and emptied
some bottles with the padre when he was out of
sight."</p>

<p>"But he is a good man."</p>

<p>"Oh, he is a saint; but we can't feel easy with saints
in San Juan. That is why your Raquel Estevan will
always be outside."</p>

<p>"You mean above," retorted Ana. "The devil's
face in the stone of the Mission dome fits better this
place of the necklace of ears."</p>

<p>Teresa shuddered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
"It is bad luck to say things of that face," she
warned. "Some think maybe it was an Indian god,&mdash;I
heard an old Indio say so once. Never will I go
under the dome of that old vestry since that day."</p>

<p>"How would an Indian god be put in a Christian
church?"</p>

<p>"No one knows," and Teresa crossed herself.
"The old Indios say it is bad luck to talk about it;
so whatever the story is, it has been forgotten, and
that is better. When I was a little child the
old Indios told strange ghost and curse stories, and
we were all much afraid; now the old Indios are
mostly dead, and no one else remembers, only all are
still afraid of the earthquake ruin at night."</p>

<p>"They are sheep; they are afraid of their shadows
at night," retorted Ana; "that is why Raquel will
always be, as you say, 'outside'!"</p>

<p>"Well, she goes against the padre, and that is
always bad. It is bad luck to fight a padre; he can
refuse absolution."</p>

<p>Ana made no reply. She was very weary of the
endless, endless stories of Raquel's unlikeness to the
other women; and what they did not understand they
would like to condemn. She knew so well that in
Mexico the Doña Luisa and the Doña Raquel had
met only the hidalgos when they went for a brief visit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
to the world of people, but in San Juan there were
no hidalgos; only the mixed races without pride of
birth or distinction, apart from the lands and cattle
around them on the ranges. Ana could feel, better
than any other, why the wife of Rafael rode alone to
the cliffs above the sea, seeking kinship there in the
isolation.</p>

<p>In vain Ana had tried to solve the problem
given her by the padre at the San Joaquin ranch
that strange evening: his quick change of attitude
toward the Americano,&mdash;even asking her friendliness
and her welcome for him if he crossed her path. The
queer idea of the Americano's love affairs was the
most puzzling of all: it never occurred to her that he
meant Raquel&mdash;Raquel, who avoided all heretics!
Still, it was strange that she never thought of the
Americano's love affair without involuntarily trying
to picture a woman who would look like Raquel. And
she did not dream those two had ever met.</p>

<p>As Pico and his men got into the saddles and
started north she heard him mention Bryton's name.
The latter had evidently tired quickly of vigilante
work; at any rate he had disappeared as effectually
as El Capitan,&mdash;no one had seen him for over a week.
And of course no one had time to hunt him up.</p>

<p>At Trabuco Creek the vigilantes passed an Indian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
boy loping easily along the valley road. When
stopped and questioned, he stated he was going to the
Mission from San Joaquin ranch. The brand on the
bronco corroborated his story, and he was let pass
with slight attention; yet they would have found him
quite worth while.</p>

<p>Ana had gone with Teresa to make a little visit to
Don Juan Alvara, who was still ill, and very impatient
at being housed up when all the world of San Juan
was astir to see the cavalcade of avengers. He was
asking sharply why Rafael Arteaga was following his
English partner's example, and keeping out of the
work of search or battle. It was to be expected that
Don Eduardo Downing, after being forced by El
Capitan to pay over a thousand dollars as tribute to
the Flores bandits, would feel that he was exempt
from active service in pursuit of them; they had cost
him quite enough. And of course he had never anything
but an alien's interest in the country, the interest
of dollars; but with Rafael Arteaga it was different.
What was he doing these days, when every man who
held stock and could fight rode abroad?</p>

<p>The women exchanged glances. Of what use to
tell Alvara it was a woman? He would only be more
disgusted, and might say things to Doña Raquel, and
that would never do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
Teresa's curiosity as to results led her very close to
it, for her new sister-in-law was a thorn in the side
of the bovine ponderous Californian, by whom the
"brown girls" had been accepted as a part of domestic
life. Ever since she had listened that day to the story
of vengeance in Old Mexico, she had resented everything
about it, even the child of that strange marriage,
the child who had inherited&mdash;who knew how
much?&mdash;of the blood and instincts of that saintly,
half-Indian nun.</p>

<p>Yes, Teresa would have dearly loved to watch
Raquel Estevan when the story was told; also the
story of Rafael's latest infatuation; yet, all the Arteaga
boys had died violent deaths, and she had no wish to
see the last one of them murdered. She was certain
that if it did happen, the ghost of Doña Luisa would
be at the foot of her bed every night, and she would
have to pay a lot for masses. They cost thirty-five
dollars since the padre was building new fences around
his orchards. So she contented herself with wishing
as much as she dared without being held liable by the
ghost of Doña Luisa in case of accidents. And then
Ana was always there with her eyes, and if any one
did tell Alvara, Ana would ferret it out, and she had
such a tongue!</p>

<p>While they reassured the old man, and told him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
the troublous days of San Juan were nearly over, the
Indian boy from the San Joaquin ranch stopped at
the gate.</p>

<p>"There is a letter for Doña Ana Mendez," he
said. "It came last night. Doña Refugia sent it."</p>

<p>"Doña Refugia?" Ana knew that her aunt could
not write, and that the accomplishments of her daughters
in that line extended to the ability to inscribe
their own names. She glanced at the message, and
her lips grew suddenly white as she noted the writing.</p>

<p>It was in pencil, written very plainly. The envelope
was folded from a page of letter-paper and sealed
with gum of some sort. When she opened it, she
found the written page was a communication to Mr.
Bryton concerning saddle-horses. But a pencil was
drawn through the lines, and around the Bryton letter
was written the real message, and it was very brief:</p>

<p><i>"A man is hurt here. Can you in quiet help him
to San Juan?"</i></p>

<p>An arrow and a cross were the only signature.</p>

<p>Teresa watched Ana questioningly. Letters to
women were rare in San Juan, where few women could
read; it must be of a death, or something of great importance.</p>

<p>But Ana told nothing, only ordered the boy to go
to Ysadora for some lunch before he started back, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
to tell Doña Refugia that all was well at San Juan.
Though Doña Teresa listened closely, that was all
she could hear that was said, and then she knew, of
course, that Ana did not intend to remain a widow.
She had a lover who wrote letters, an Americano perhaps;
the Mexicans did not trouble themselves with
such useless learning, now that the old padres were gone.</p>

<p>Ana sat quietly on the veranda for a little while,
speaking of matters in general, and then arose languidly
and confessed she wished she had gone with
Raquel. A ride to the beach was better than to stay
shut up in the town. Now that the vigilantes had
gone, women would dare ride abroad without growing
gray with fear.</p>

<p>"Ai! it is not far you would ride, Ana Mendez.
You are like other women when it comes to riding
alone these days."</p>

<p>"Raquel rides alone."</p>

<p>"Her mother was not of this country, or she would
not be so bold," returned Teresa, tartly. "Men have
little liking for women as strong as themselves."</p>

<p>"Alas for me!" laughed Ana, "for I tell you now
I am going to copy after her. She makes the other
women look like sheep. If she would go with me, I
would ride to the San Joaquin ranch this night and
have no fear."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Teresa shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"You grow like a child, Ana, as you get more years.
Your letter makes you young again&mdash;so?"</p>

<p>But Ana was out of the gate, and crossing the plaza
with a light springy step, as if indeed the days of girlhood
had come back. In her eyes was a smile, but
back of the smile was a light of new determination.
All at once she seemed to have found herself: he was
in danger, and had called her.</p>

<p>At the Mission she found the Indian boy with a
dish of frijolles.</p>

<p>"How did the letter come?" she asked, but he did
not know. It was found under the door, and it had
frightened Doña Refugia, and she wanted it out of
the house when the men were away. She thought it,
maybe, was a demand for money, such as the outlaws
had sent Señor Eduardo Downing, and she asked Ana
for the love of God to send word back quick what
it meant.</p>

<p>"It is only from the padre who borrowed the
horse, and he thanks her," said Ana, coolly. "Ride
straight home, and talk to no one, or you will get a
reata instead of frijolles."</p>

<p>The Indian boy nodded silently. He knew the
Doña Ana always kept her promises of that sort.</p>

<p>A little later, Teresa looked out at the sound of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
horse-hoofs thundering by, and saw Ana on the road
to the sea.</p>

<p>She let her horse have his head until she came to
the Rancho de la Playa, when she halted to scan the
meadow and sand of the shore, and then bent her
attention to the ground, and paced slowly along until
she found the tracks of Raquel's horse turning to the
right. There was only one road to be followed to
the right; she had gone through the little cañon of
the cactus and up to the heights above. More than
once Doña Ana halted to examine the ground, to be
sure that no later tracks had been made on a return
trip. Then, away across the mesa she saw Raquel's
horse browsing among the sage-brush on the cliff
above the sea. Raquel was nowhere in sight; but,
knowing she was near, Ana rode quietly along the
bluff, until right at the edge of the cliff she saw her
stretched at full length in the odorous grasses,
her chin propped on her hands, staring down the
steeps where yellow poppies nodded to the surf below.
A cluster of the blossoms was beside her, and her
skirt was torn. She had evidently been down there
after them, and was resting after her climb.</p>

<p>"What is it, Anita?" she asked after a brief
upward glance. "Is there a spirit of unrest with you
also? Some say there is sleep and forgetfulness in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
these little cups of gold. I have gathered some and
lain here a long time, but it is not true, Anita. There
is no forgetting."</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a href='images/p278p.jpg'>
	<img src='images/p278w.jpg'
	title='There is No Forgetting' alt='There is No Forgetting' />
</a>
<p>&ldquo;There is No Forgetting&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Ana slipped from the saddle and came closer.
Never before had so much of confession been heard
from Raquel Arteaga.</p>

<p>"What, then, do you try to forget, my darling?"
she asked, caressingly. "Your love and happiness?"</p>

<p>"Love is not happiness," said Raquel, and laid her
cheek against the sheaf of poppies. "Why do people
say so? Do they wish to lie, or do they not know?
The heart does not laugh with love; it aches. The
light and the glory of it comes, and after that comes
the earthquake; and the life is shaken out of us, and
all we can do is to make ourselves a sacrifice."</p>

<p>"Holy saints! I never knew love was all that!"
acknowledged Ana. "It means also to dance, to
listen to your lover's songs in the night under your
window, and to go to sleep satisfied that he is not with
some other girl. It means stolen looks like kisses. I
never am sure but that they are sweeter than the
kisses themselves, though they do not make one
mad."</p>

<p>Raquel looked at her, and smiled strangely, and
rose to her feet.</p>

<p>"Ai! you are right, Anita; it is without doubt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
more wise to love like that. All the girls in the
willows think so." As she saw Ana's face flush, she
turned in quick contrition. "Ah, forgive me! You
do not love as they do, I am sure&mdash;those fat brown
animals; but, Anita darling, I am a tired soul, and
rest is somewhere far beyond the ranges, and&mdash;ah,
well,&mdash;forgive me!"</p>

<p>Ana smiled and shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Why should I not?" she asked; "for, after all, you
are right. All human things are much alike when
they love&mdash;the brown girls in the willows also. They
nurse their babies and thank the Virgin they are not
childless, as I am."</p>

<p>"And you&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I am thankful to be as I am. When I have children,
I want to love the father of them. My people
did not ask if I loved my husband. They made the
marriage, and God made me a widow. I thank God
always that when I marry again I can do my own
choosing."</p>

<p>"Oh, when you marry again! Good! When is it
to be?"</p>

<p>Ana laughed and then grew grave.</p>

<p>"You may help me to decide," she said, a trifle
nervously. "I am going to elope to-night. Will
you ride along?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
"Anita!"</p>

<p>"It is up there," and Ana waved her hand toward
the blue mountains above Trabuco. "It is a long
ride, but the moon shines, and&mdash;I am trusting you!"</p>

<p>"And the man?"</p>

<p>"Your husband hates him, and will find fault
if you go."</p>

<p>"And he does not come to you?"</p>

<p>"He is&mdash;I think he is hurt," said Ana. "And I
am going, though I go alone."</p>

<p>"You shall not go alone," and Raquel whistled
to her horse. "Come! I needed something of this
sort to rouse me from poppy dreams. I ride with
you, my Anita; and the man, whoever he is, has
my blessing."</p>

<p>They galloped together through the sweet-smelling
grasses, and a load was lifted from Ana's heart.
With Raquel beside her, she could ride care-free from
danger to the man who had called her.</p>

<p>"I have not been told to take any one along,"
she confessed, "so I cannot mention names; but
there is a man hurt, and we must manage to get extra
horses away from the Mission, and things to eat,
perhaps, for we go where no people live; and&mdash;I&mdash;that
is all I dare tell you."</p>

<p>"It is enough, my Anita. We will ride together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
like nobles of old Spain seeking adventures, only
we will storm no castles, and wear no colors to denote
our caballeros!"</p>

<p>She was elated as a child over the secret journey
they were to take over unknown roads. The poppy
dreams were left at the edge of the cliff, and she
rode lightly across the divide, where at other times
she ever halted for the picture of ocean and valley
stretching from San Mateo at the sea to San Jacinto
of the ranges.</p>

<p>"I knew it was love in thy heart for some one,
Anita," she said, smiling. "Religion alone does not
make a woman comprehend heartaches for other
women. You are the only one of all of them who
asks no questions, yet you put your arms around me
that crazy night when I rode from Los Angeles,
and all at once I felt that I need not hold with tired
hands a mask to my face for you."</p>

<p>"Holy Mary! I know, and why not? My family
married me to the wrong man," said Ana, easily.
"But I was lucky in one thing, and I know enough
now to thank the saints for it,&mdash;I had not learned
what love meant, so the other man had not come."</p>

<p>"And if he had?"</p>

<p>They had checked their speed to descend the steep
ravine cut in the heart of the mesa, and giving outlet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
to the blue sea. Raquel was intent, apparently, on
finding the best footing for her horse, and did not
look up at once, but when no reply came she tried
to laugh, and repeated the question.</p>

<p>"I did not answer," said Ana, after a moment,
"because, Raquelita, when you made me think of it,
truly it seemed as if my heart stopped beating that
minute. Poor José, my husband! It would have
gone hard with him, and my relatives would have
cursed me."</p>

<p>"And why?"</p>

<p>"I think I should have risked the purgatory they
would have sent me to, but I would ride as we are
riding now, straight to the man&mdash;the one man."</p>

<p>"And suppose&mdash;suppose, Anita, you were bound
by a vow to the dead&mdash;could you ride away from
that? Suppose that so long as you lived you were
set to guard one living soul&mdash;that each day when
you awoke, your prayers were to keep worthy for the
task; suppose&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no! I will not suppose. A woman can
endure just so much, no more. I know you are
doing all this, my Raquel, and I see that it is forever
one big fight and sacrifice, and all your life it will be
the same. But, Raquel, when you awake and pray
each morning, thank the Virgin at the same time that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
the other man has not yet ridden into your heart. I
know you do not think of men&mdash;that it is to live ever
in cloisters! But pray God that the man may never
come, Raquel&mdash;for a girl is only a girl, after all!"</p>

<p>"Of course, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you would argue, because you do not
know!" burst out Ana, with impatience. "Raquel,
you are so good you are always beautiful; but I
tell you truly, that if it should happen&mdash;all the
saints could not help you. Between your vow for
the soul of Rafael and your love for the one man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, my Anita?"</p>

<p>"Well, you could not live through it and remain
what you are. Any woman would go mad&mdash;any
woman."</p>

<p>Raquel touched her horse and galloped up the
steep hill ahead of Ana. Down the longer one to
Boca de la Playa she rode in the same reckless way,
and it was not until they had reached El Camino
Real that she pulled her horse in, and allowed Ana
to come alongside.</p>

<p>"Jesusita! how you ride away from me!" gasped
her friend. "Wait until I braid up my hair. Look
at it&mdash;all the new pins lost, the pretty ones you
brought me from Los Angeles. We will send a boy
back to hunt them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
Raquel sat silent on her panting horse, looking
out on the wide sea and saying nothing. Ana
glanced at her white face while braiding her hair,
and thought it looked cold and determined, almost
angry; and as they started on once more, she reached
across and touched her hand.</p>

<p>"Do not make your eyes like cold agates of violet,"
she entreated. "Truly, I meant not to anger you, and
I know you are good always, and think only of your
vows. But even the saints have known temptation,
my Raquel, and some who might have been saints
have lost souls for a man or a woman."</p>

<p>"Oh, my own soul!" and Raquel shrugged her
shoulders with a dreary smile. "It is the soul of
Rafael I am set to guard. Only that must I think of
every day of my life. My own! Only Mother
Mary knows what my own may become."</p>

<p>"His mother knew the power of the heretics; it
was not fair, Raquelita."</p>

<p>"It is judgment," said Raquel, steadily. "I asked
God to give me some work for the Church in the
world, instead of within the convent walls. It was
brought to me; I accepted it on my knees. What
any of us think now does not change that in the least.
I must live till I die with that thought."</p>

<p>"So I know," conceded Ana, "and so I thank God
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
the other man does not come. You would know
then how to feel sympathy for the women who fail,
or the women who do mad things such as I mean to
do to-night."</p>

<p>"Do I not understand? Do I not go with you?
Yes, ahead of you, for my horse beats yours," replied
Raquel; and from that to the Mission plaza there
was only the sound of hoof-beats on the hard road,
and no more words of love or lovers.</p>

<p>A man had come from San Diego with a message
from Rafael Arteaga. He would be at San Juan in a
few days, and was bringing guests for a barbecue.
Strange word had come from the vigilantes of the disappearance
of Bryton, the Americano. It had been
learned that he had not returned to Los Angeles,
neither had he gone south. To free Mrs. Bryton
from anxiety, Rafael and Don Eduardo meant to find
him and make a holiday while doing it.</p>

<p>Raquel Arteaga listened, and Ana noticed all at
once how white and tired she looked from the little
gallop.</p>

<p>"Get down from the saddle, my dear," she said,
appealingly. "Lift her, you, Victorio. Mother
Mary! Do not faint, Raquel!"</p>

<p>Raquel did not faint. She thanked the muscular
Victorio, who lifted her from the saddle as though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
she had been but a little child, and placed her on one
of the long seats of brick, while Ana ran for water,
and old Polonia crouched beside her and looked up in
her face, but did not speak. She had heard the name
of the hated Americano, and she had no need to ask
questions. It was the witchcraft come over her again;
even the sound of his name could bring it!</p>

<p>"No, I am not ill, Ana. I really am not," she
persisted. "You say I turn white. Well, it may be I
had no dinner&mdash;I think I forgot it, or those heroes
the vigilantes took my appetite. See! I can stand;
I am quite well. I am ready for the San Joaquin
ride when the sun goes down."</p>

<p>"But, if harm should come?"</p>

<p>"Never fear. To go will not harm me. I am
very strong&mdash;stronger than you think. Ai! I
shall live long&mdash;a long, long time, Anita!"</p>

<p>She arose and passed through the door of the
carved Aztec sun and little half-crescents, and Ana
looked after her doubtfully.</p>

<p>"It is the Americana?" said Victorio, with a shrug
and lifted brows. "Rafael Arteaga is mad after that
baby woman&mdash;just mad. I think it makes Doña
Maria afraid. It would not be well to have the
wrong things happen in her house; so they jump at
the chance to ride north together, for any reason at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
all, and bring Don Rafael to his own wife. That is
all the reason they come: Doña Maria is afraid."</p>

<p>"But to bring them here! The Doña Raquel is
not fond of heretics."</p>

<p>"I think myself it is the woman and not the
religion she will think of when they come," said
Victorio; "and she must have heard something,&mdash;what
else made her look like that?"</p>

<p>"Who knows? A woman may be tired, may she
not? You talk a great deal for a man of your years!"</p>

<p>"Oh, it is only to you, Señora. It is as well some
one knows who is a friend,&mdash;that pretty white baby
of a woman has the 'money eye.' Some one should
warn Doña Raquel, for who knows where it will end?
You know the Arteaga men."</p>

<p>Ana nodded her head.</p>

<p>"We all know them; but, thanks to God, the
right woman has come into the family. I do not
know what she will do&mdash;Estevan's daughter; but
Rafael will learn what a curb-bit means if he go too
far. Women who do not care whether they live or
die are more reckless than the wildest man, Victorio;
and Rafael will do well to say good-bye to heretic
pets."</p>

<p>Victorio shrugged his shoulders, and did not quite
believe. Of course a woman could do a lot with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
man if he was not so foolish as to marry her, but
after that what could she do but keep the home and
obey? Some of them found other amusements when
their husbands rode abroad, but what more could they
do than that, even the most powerful?</p>

<p>Of course if Doña Raquel were not his wife, Rafael
might be faithful: Victorio acknowledged he knew
how that was himself. There was a woman who kept
his house, and now after four years of content, the
padre was at him for a marriage fee, and was putting
the devil in the woman's head, and there was discord.
All had been content for all those years, but when
the marriage was even talked of, there was trouble;
and Victorio had no use for it except, of course, if the
woman was dying, or if he was&mdash;then the padre could
get the marriage made. The money was saved up in
case of such need for absolution, but otherwise&mdash;</p>

<p>Ana interrupted him angrily, though she knew he
voiced the masculine opinion of the valley. She had
heard the padre complain that the women had also
refused marriage for the same reason; so there was
little could be done, and she knew that if Rafael
Arteaga should fail openly within the year of his
marriage, there would be laughs and shrugs, and the
marriage fees would be fewer than ever. The example
of their superiors was all that was needed to break all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
the little invisible bonds told of in the prayer-books,
but remembered so little in the everyday life.</p>

<p>"Oh, you need not rail at me, Doña Ana," protested
Victorio; "I am only one&mdash;and I feed my
children! You do not believe so much in Rafael
Arteaga yourself; and, after all, it may come right.
It depends most on the woman."</p>

<p>"Doña Raquel Arteaga?"</p>

<p>"Never! She is only a wife; it is the other who is
still <i>the</i> woman."</p>

<p>Ana flung an angry look at the pessimistic, philosophic
vaquero, and followed Raquel, slamming the
door after her to emphasize her impatience with his
all-too-true statements.</p>

<p>She checked her tempestuous entrance at sight of
the wife they were discussing, kneeling at the little
altar in the corner of her own room. The tall candles
were lit, and before the shrine of the Virgin Raquel
was prostrate.</p>

<p>Ana crossed herself and went out softly, half afraid
that the argument in the corridor had been heard
through the thick adobe walls. This new sign of
Raquel's disfavor at every mention of the Americanos
gave Ana several unpleasant moments. The letter
now in her pocket had belonged to the Americano
whom they were coming to search for: dare she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
mention it to the girl kneeling there at the shrine?
Or did not the news brought by Victorio Lopez make
more imperative the need for secrecy? In riding the
hills for Bryton, what others hidden there might be
discovered for death?</p>

<p>Ana sent an Indian with a pack-mule of provisions
to the sheep-herders' cabin in Trabuco cañon, with
instructions to wait there until the men came for it,
and in every way made smooth the details for the
journey of the night.</p>

<p>Don Antonio, the major-domo for the Arteagas,
had ridden north with the vigilantes, so there was no
one to oppose or question the order of Ana, given in
the name of Doña Raquel.</p>

<p>Teresa shrugged her shoulders and said some
things when the two mounted and rode gaily northward.
She hoped Doña Refugia would say some things
to them for the good of their souls when they reached
the ranch. Ana had always been a little rebel; it was
well they married her when they did! No one gave
much heed to Ana's vagaries or strange whims, but
with Raquel it was different. The opinions of Doña
Luisa concerning the convent novice secured as a
daughter were well known in the San Juan valley:
she was a saint, no less. But Teresa watched the
slender girlish form riding away on the black horse,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
and hated the grace and daring of her as only gross
creatures can hate refined ones, and had her own
ideas of two women who were young, riding like
that toward darkness,&mdash;the darkness where even men
scarcely dared ride alone these days. One might be
saintly in soul, yet do indiscreet things in this
mundane world. And Teresa wished them a lesson,
from the centre of her fat heart.</p>

<p>The dark was falling when the two
girls reached the sheep-herders'
cabin in Trabuco. José, the
boy with the pack-mules and
the led horse, had arrived before
them, and, shaking with fear,
had built a fire with which to
banish the threatening shadows. No herders were
there, and to stay in the isolated cañon with the mule
and mustang was not to his taste. José belonged to
the Mission garden work, or the driving of the cows to
pasture, and had little relish for the adventurous life
of the ranges. He appreciated not at all the confidence
placed in him by the laughing Doña Ana.</p>

<p>But Ana had no desire to trust an older man,
even an Indian, and when they reached the cabin she
delighted his soul by giving him a gold piece, the first
he had ever earned, and telling him to go straight
back to San Juan; and unless he wanted his own ears
to wear on a string around his neck, he was to utter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
no word of having seen any one at the sheep-herders'
cabin. His task was over when he left the provisions
and extra horses there.</p>

<p>Glad enough to escape so easily from the prospect
of a night where wild cats and mountain lions were no
strangers, José not only promised, but swore by the
Virgin and Jesusita that no one at San Juan should
be the wiser for his having seen the ladies in that devil
of a cañon. If they never came out alive, he would
confess to the padre before All Souls' Day, but until
then not a word would they get from him even by
whippings and salt water!</p>

<p>Despite the fervor of his protestations, Ana rode up
the terrace of the mesa, and sat there watching the
trail along the creek until she saw him cross far below,
a moving dot against the yellow stretch of sand, and
knew that he was indeed moved by winged fear and
had none of the courage for spy's work.</p>

<p>Raquel watched the first star break through the
blue, and knew that, if he was alive, somewhere in
the width of California a man watched it also, and
shut out for one brief instant any crowding humanity
surrounding him. It seemed a very far-away thing,
this tryst of the star, and never&mdash;never, any day of
her life, durst she dream of bringing it closer.</p>

<p>Ana found her huddled in the crooked white arm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
of a great aliso tree, and regarded with dismay the
quivering shoulders and face hidden against the white
bark.</p>

<p>The Aliso Tree.</p>
</div>

<p>"Raquelita!" she said, in quick contrition. "I
have asked too much of you, to ride with me blindfold
into the wilderness. Say so, and ride back while
it is yet light to reach the road. It was wrong to ask
you to share burdens of others. I am at your feet,
darling. Do not blame me too much, for&mdash;"</p>

<p>Raquel lifted her head and looked at her, and
smiled through tears.</p>

<p>"Anita mia, you cannot send me back, for I will
not go. Do not fancy me unhappy because&mdash;oh&mdash;because
of anything. I feel, here in the open, more
at home than any moment since I came to California.
We were of the hill folk, my mother's people, and
out under the stars in the night all their old buried
instincts awake in me&mdash;the pagan gladness of the
wilderness."</p>

<p>"You do not look glad," said Ana, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Child, child! who of us is glad with unmixed
gladness, after the door has been closed on our youth
and the dreams of youth?"</p>

<p>She slid from her perch and slipped her hand
through her friend's arm.</p>

<p>"But to-night, beloved, we will close other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
doors&mdash;the doors of the world of people. This tree shall be
the last landmark; beyond this we ride over enchanted
ground, and fancy all wild sweet things of our destination.
You go to&mdash;to your lover, perhaps; and I&mdash;I
ride to dream dreams in the open."</p>

<p>"But, Raquelita&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never fear they will lead us too far astray, the
harmless dreams," she laughed. "If they do, I shall
do heavy penance; be sure of that!"</p>

<p>"You look like a witch, instead of a devotee, in
this half-light," observed Ana. "Your eyes are like
stars; and&mdash;what has wakened in you this wild
mood? Is it the wilderness alone?"</p>

<p>"Not quite," acknowledged Raquel, demurely.
"Since you will have a definite cause, I will confess,
Anita mia, that it was the white, strong arms of&mdash;of&mdash;never
look so frightened, dear,&mdash;of my friend the
aliso tree!"</p>

<p>They both laughed, but Ana sat a moment by the
little camp-fire and stared at her.</p>

<p>"That is all very well, and you have your good
fun with me," she said; "but out here you are a
different person from the lady of your cloisters. Yet
nothing has happened to make you different&mdash;nothing,
except that we are in the open."</p>

<p>"Nothing? O thou wise one!" mocked Raquel.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
"But a star shone out, and its rays bewitch people
sometimes, when it shines down into the heart until
the radiance there is too great for one little bosom to
hold; and it trembles to the lips, and all the eager
longings of the world are understood, and one feels
very, very close to one's own soul; and one feels that
just beyond that star, or just beyond the bend of the
trail up here, one might find it. So, let us ride hard
and fast, my Anita,&mdash;I to my bewitched fancies, and
you to your lover."</p>

<p>"And I&mdash;I thought you did not understand!"
muttered Ana. "That was because never before
have I seen you without the hedges of people about
you. God forgive Rafael Arteaga, who has known
and ridden away!"</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Raquel; "our outer world is on the
other side of the aliso tree. That is our plaza, and
this the inner court. Life itself has the same divisions:
all the world may cross the plaza, but the
inner court of one's own soul is the sanctuary, where
only one may kneel beside us; it is the tabernacle of
the heart, and no word of Church or your own will
can give to anyone the key, or&mdash;Santa Maria!&mdash;take
it out of the hands to which it is given by divine
right!"</p>

<p>"Raquel, beloved!" cried Ana, in dismay, "you


<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
are not laughing at me now. You make my heart
ache with your words and your smile,&mdash;more with the
smile, I think. And what you say is&mdash;is almost
sacrilege. No Spanish mother teaches her daughter
that the sacrament of the Church is not, above all
things, binding. Those who break it are taught the
sin of it."</p>

<p>"But I had no Spanish mother to teach me; only
a priest and an old Indian woman. The nuns never
spoke of the worldly ties, they were so sure I should
never know them."</p>

<p>"But, Raquelita, you rode gladly north to Rafael; you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes; I was more a devotee than I ever shall be
again," acknowledged Raquel, with a sigh. "I remember
the elated, half-dreamlike way in which I rode
over those mesas to meet him. I was riding to help
to guard a wonderful soul and a wonderful life for the
Church. I was upheld by the conviction that God
desired it. If, instead of asking me to marry a
husband for the good of a soul, they had asked me to
ride my horse into the sea and wait for the rising tide,
and given as convincing a churchly reason, I should
have ridden into the sea and waited, I suppose. It is
bad for one when the dreams go, and the clear vision
begins."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
"But Rafael&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Rafael, beloved, is contented with the life of the
plaza. He will always be; and&mdash;the inner court is
forever this side of the aliso tree. Come! The stars
are thick now, and if we have far to ride&mdash;"</p>

<p>Doña Ana untied the mule and the mustang.</p>

<p>"I think they will follow; but it is best, perhaps, to
keep a rope on the mustang. I will lead him, and I
have a bell I will tie later to his neck; it may help in
the dark if we should go wide of the trail."</p>

<p>An Inner Court.</p>
</div>

<p>The wilder mood of Raquel in the great out-of-doors,
where she became something besides the girl of
the cloisters, had a sobering effect on Ana herself. A
girl who would sacrifice herself through a temporary
religious fervor was not one to look with favor on any
sacrifice or risk for heretics. Again and again she
thought of the letter to the Americano on which that
message had been pencilled. She thought also of the
words of friendship uttered by Padre Libertad for
the same American, at the San Joaquin ranch. Was
it that the latter was dead, and thus his letters accessible?
Or was there a chance that the man whom Don
Eduardo and his guests were to start in search of was
held either by a friend or an enemy in the hills they
were riding to?</p>

<p>She had felt sure, without hearing it put into words,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
that Raquel rode from the ranch that night to avoid
Mrs. Bryton. What other reason could there be?
Therefore, was it fair to lead her blindfold to meet
another of that heretic family, to whom she would not
open her door even to please her husband? They
had mounted their horses when the certainty that it
was not fair came upon Ana, and she slipped from the
saddle and stirred up the sulking embers of the little
fire until it broke into a blaze.</p>

<p>"Raquel, it is no use! I must tell you before we
start. The man I go to see is the friend of a heretic
whom you bar out from your knowledge. The message
sent me is written on a letter of Bryton's. You
heard them say Señor Bryton cannot be found; and
there is a chance&mdash;only a chance&mdash;that he may be in
the mountain where we are going."</p>

<p>Raquel stared at her, and did not speak. In the
flickering light Ana could see that her eyes grew
large&mdash;with dread, or anger, or what? Even her lips
grew pale, and she almost seemed to sway in the saddle.</p>

<p>"Raquelita mia, I was wrong, I know it was wrong
to bring you; but oh, my beloved&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;did not know&mdash;he&mdash;was here?"</p>

<p>"I did not think. The devil put mud where my
brain should be! It is only when we are on the road
it commences to trouble me; and now your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
words&mdash;your&mdash;Oh, I know that of all women in California,
you hate the heretics most; and now it is I
who&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tell me what the letter says," interrupted Raquel,
who now sat erect in the saddle, rigid and white.
"You said your friend was hurt and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Some one is hurt; I do not know who. You can
read the letter if you bend down here. Who knows?
It may be his American friend."</p>

<p>"Mother mia! It may be, it may be!"</p>

<p>She covered her face with her hands, and Ana,
looking at her, thought she was praying for strength
to remember humanity ahead of the creeds. At last
she spoke.</p>

<p>"Anita mia, never feel so badly about it. We did
not plan this, you and I, but it happens&mdash;it happens!
There is only one straight thing to do: I can ride
back to San Juan when you learn the truth. If it is
the Americano, the word shall go to his wife quickly.
I need not see the man, but I can carry a message,
and I will; God helping me to the strength, I will!"</p>

<p>"His wife? Santa Maria! The man has no wife.
Half the girls of Los Angeles county try to marry
him, but it is never any use."</p>

<p>"Anita!"</p>

<p>"How you stare at me, Raquel! You think I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
mean some other American, maybe. No? I speak
of Don Keith Bryton. You hate them all so; no
one ever speaks of them to you; but he is not bad.
He saved your Indian woman at the ranch while you
slept. You did not know it all."</p>

<p>"Stop, and let me think," said Raquel, imperatively.
"Some one has lied. Who is the fair woman with
the blue eyes&mdash;the Mrs. Bryton&mdash;the Doña Angela
he drove with&mdash;the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She is the widow of his half-brother; that is all."</p>

<p>"All? Then how&mdash;why should Teresa say this
thing? Yesterday I heard her say that Doña Angela
made a flirtation with Rafael only to make Señor
Bryton jealous. I heard it, though she did not know.
Why should that be, if it is only his brother's wife?"</p>

<p>"Oh, God alone knows the heart of a woman,
Raquel! It may be all a lie. Our people do not
understand the gringo women. They look love to so
many men, and mean it, perhaps, for none. But it
was thought, yes, plainly said, when she first came to
Los Angeles, that Keith Bryton was the one man she
wanted to marry. But that is all over now; no one
thinks&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Teresa thinks."</p>

<p>"Teresa had better be at her prayers! I could tell
you something strange of Keith Bryton,&mdash;only you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
are not interested in gringos,&mdash;something of a love
of his, and I feel sure it is never the pretty Doña
Angela."</p>

<p>"Tell me," said Raquel, coldly.</p>

<p>"A man&mdash;a priest&mdash;learned it from him some
way. I thought the Americanos had no saints; but
something like a love for a saint keeps Keith Bryton
from caring much for any one else. It is as if a
woman, instead of a wooden saint, should be in one
of the niches of the old altar-place, and he said
prayers there. Whoever she is, she seems to be very
far above him&mdash;like the star he cannot reach."</p>

<p>"The men who cannot reach the stars content
themselves with picking flowers, do they not?"</p>

<p>"Oh, God alone knows how they content themselves!
I only tell you this thing to show you that
Señor Bryton has not anywhere in the land a woman to
go to him if he were dying alone in the hills; his saint
would not step down from the niche of the altar-place."</p>

<p>"Anita mia, you forget," she said, in a strange,
mocking tone. "If Keith Bryton is a friend of yours,
you should wish him better fortune than to kneel at a
place like our old altar. Do you forget that of the
eleven niches still left in the old ruin, only one holds
a saint,&mdash;a saint where no one openly kneels,&mdash;that
of the Maria Madalena?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
"Raquel, what things you do fancy! Now that
you know whom you may have to meet, will you ride
with me, or back to the road?"</p>

<p>"Back to the plaza?" asked Doña Raquel. "Anita
mia, all this has come to me in the inner court of
the aliso portal: it does not belong to the outer world;
neither do we, I think, to-night. Whatever the
shadows of the cañon cover for us, I think, we must
ride upward to meet them. Your friend's saint, the
Madalena of the niche, will watch over us. When we
go back she shall have candles and roses&mdash;red ones,
Anita!"</p>

<p>Ana was voluble in her delight, and rode up the
valley with a great load lifted from her heart.</p>

<p>But the witching spell of the aliso portal had lost
its gay charm for Raquel, or else it had sent her another
more potent, for she rode in silence under the stars,
without gladness, yet so steadily, so recklessly, that
Ana more than once had to complain that only a deer
or a coyote could keep ahead of her.</p>

<p>That same evening a gay party
from the south rode along the
sea to San Juan Capistrano.
Doña Maria and Don Eduardo
rode in a carriage, but the
Doña Angela had received riding
lessons from Rafael, and
disdained now the lounging ease of the cushioned seats.
She and Rafael galloped far ahead at times, and then
loitered idly among the odorous grasses and chaparral,
and watched the waves roll in, and said the gay, foolish
things that sometimes mean only courtesy, and
sometimes mean the ripples of thought fringing pools
of unsounded depths. There was little doubt of the
quality of Rafael's thought. Whatever it had been
in the commencement, there was little now within
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
his power to accomplish which he would not have
done at the bidding of her smiling childish lips.</p>

<p>"If we had a boat out there where the whitecaps
are, we could go even faster than the horses," she was
saying. "I always wanted a boat; I always wanted to
live near the ocean, if only the right people could
be with me."</p>

<p>"You shall have a boat, any day you want it," he
said, eagerly. "They make them at San Pedro; that
is not far to send. A boat, and a house by the sea!
Why not wish for a more difficult thing? Would you
like that bluff above the river's mouth? Or Dana's
Point, beyond there? You could watch the whales
spouting from the quay, and all the sea and valley
could be yours at a glance, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And a fine view, also, of your monastery walls, far,
far away, Don Rafael."</p>

<p>"I should never be far away, only as far as you bid
me go."</p>

<p>"Ah! that sounds very submissive," she replied;
"but you are not really so, not really. I&mdash;I want
to say to you that my cousin's wife reproves me for
your&mdash;your&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her hesitation was very pretty. It delighted the
man, who caught her hand and kissed it.</p>

<p>"My&mdash;my&mdash;you can find no word, madama, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
my madness; is that it?" he asked, softly. "You are
right; there are no words ever coined to cover it. I
make myself a carpet for your feet, mi corazon!"</p>

<p>"I don't want a carpet for my feet,&mdash;at least I
think I do not," she said, doubtfully, "not in the
face of all the frowns of California; and we perhaps
go to-day where we see many frowns from my cousin.
She says she may not visit your wife. Why?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps she does not like a home where there are
endless prayers," he said, briefly; "but, such as it is,
it is for you, madama. You would light up even the
shadows there. As for the Doña Maria, she is&mdash;ah,
well, she is old, and forgets many things. She has
had her own romances, and they should teach her
charity! The plans she makes in San Diego and on the
road are all right for those places, but when we reach
San Juan you all go to my home. I sent word ahead."</p>

<p>"Your wife expects us to-night?"</p>

<p>"She does not know what night, or what day, but
she will expect you."</p>

<p>"She does not care at all for people, does she?"
and Angela's eyes were turned from him to the sea.
"All this wonderful principality of a place, and a
home like a ruined castle, and the boxes of jewels they
say she never looks at! She must be a marvellous
woman,&mdash;the Doña Raquel Arteaga. I shall feel a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
little afraid, I think, of the magnificence she disdains."</p>

<p>"A finer castle will go up on those bluffs when you
say the word, madama mia; and the jewels&mdash;one can
always find more pearls in the sea!"</p>

<p>"How often shall I have to tell you that you must
not make those foolish promises to me? You, a
married man!"</p>

<p>"Just so often as you make me forget the marriage&mdash;and
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Adam!" she laughed. "Of course it is to be the
woman's fault,&mdash;'She tempted me!'"</p>

<p>She sprang to her feet and ran to her horse as the
carriage came in sight over the mesa. He was by her
side in an instant.</p>

<p>"And that, madama, is every time I hear your voice,
or look in your eyes, or feel the touch of your hand!
Ah, beloved!"</p>

<p>"If you kiss me, Don Rafael, remember I cannot go
to the house of your wife!"</p>

<p>He released her with a groan, and stared at her as
she leaned panting against her horse.</p>

<p>"You put a man in purgatory, madama," he
said, between shut teeth. "But it must end&mdash;only
Christ knows how! It must end one of these
days."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
He lifted her to the saddle and kept his arms about
her, looking up into her face.</p>

<p>"Was that about the boat all a jest? Once before
you spoke of a boat&mdash;and us two. Perhaps it was
only your woman's way to torture a man by helping
him to think of that sort of heaven! But, after all,
what is all this life here to you? You care nothing
for the people; you will go away somewhere, some day,
and no one will ever hear of you again. What better
way, after all, than the boat? It leaves no tracks;
there would be all the world before us."</p>

<p>"Hush!" she said, with a little smile. "Who
is now the tempter? You are quite mad, Don
Rafael."</p>

<p>"God!" he muttered. "If I could only have the
happiness of knowing it <i>was</i> a temptation to you!"</p>

<p>She smiled again, and touched her horse with the
quirt; and though he caught his horse and mounted
quickly, she was a considerable distance ahead of him,
and perversely insisted on keeping a wide space between
them, or else lagging beside the carriage for
conversation with Doña Maria, whom Rafael knew
she loved little.</p>

<p>For the rest of the ride there was no chance of a
word alone with her. Only as they turned from the
beach to the river valley she checked her horse for an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
instant, and with a little flash of a glance toward him,
she flung a kiss from the tips of her fingers to the
bluffs above San Juan River.</p>

<p>"Adios, O castle of the air in which Love might
have lived! Adios, O boat of beautiful dreams, for
which there is no harbor! Don Rafael, you sing so
well&mdash;could you not put the castle and the boat in a
Spanish song! It would sound pretty in a love-song,
and it is much too romantic for every-day life; for,
after all, there is no harbor here."</p>

<p>He devoured her with sombre eyes of desire, and a
glint of rage showing through their ardent depths.</p>

<p>"There will be a harbor, madama mia," he muttered.
"By the God and all the saints, there will be a harbor
here on the San Juan shore, and there will be an embarcodera!
And the boat will&mdash;will not be a boat in
a song or a dream, madama mia! I swear it, I swear
it, I swear it!"</p>

<p>He dug his spurs viciously into his mount to
emphasize the words, and the animal reared and
plunged, and gave him a chance to vent his feelings
somewhat, while the Doña Angela tried to laugh, and
failed. A passion like that was a very masterful force,
and there had been times when she dared not treat it
as a jest.</p>

<p>The shrewd, red-faced ranchman, riding in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
carriage beside his swarthy wife, noted the little pantomime
and nodded to Doña Maria.</p>

<p>"It is as you say, dear. It is better that Don
Rafael be with his own wife. If anything should
happen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If one thing should happen, we should be
blamed; even the bishop might blame us," said Doña
Maria, fretfully. "She could marry with other men:
what white devil in her turns her to that mad Rafael?
The Arteaga men always have their own way. She
should be married."</p>

<p>Her husband grunted assent, and regarded the fair
figure of his kinswoman riding sedately along the
green. She was such a fragile, childlike creature,
he thought of her as a little yellow canary, pretty to
see around the home after the many years lived
among the dark people; but he never was certain in
the least that he knew her, and he was beginning to
consider some arrangement by which, for the good of
the doll-like child asleep on the carriage cushions, he
could suggest that she return to the land of the
Briton and abide there&mdash;with, of course, a comfortable
little sum for maintenance. Don Eduardo was too
much of a politician not to see the wisdom of buying
off embarrassing friends; the Doña Angela in her
amusements might prove not only embarrassing, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
dangerous. He had plans concerning certain Arteaga
holdings, and could not have even a charming woman
enter into his scheme of things, if she suggested
discord. And watching Rafael Arteaga's face and the
reckless passion in it, Don Eduardo decided that his
fair countrywoman not only suggested discord, she
was a living, breathing, alluring promise of it!</p>

<p>A sunset in San Juan is truly worth crossing either
a continent or an ocean to witness, when the ranges
toward La Paz are purple where the sage-brush is, and
rose-color where the rains have washed the steep
places to the clay, and over all of mesa and mountain
the soft glory of golden haze. All that radiance
touched the land and sea as the carriage of Don
Eduardo, preceded by Rafael and Doña Angela, and
followed by Fernando and Juanita, who had been a
guest of Doña Maria, and back of all the rest the
Indian servants and the nurse for the child on the
carriage cushion. Amid the shrill calls of greeting,
and gay exchange of words and laughter, the cavalcade
passed the Casa Grande of Don Juan Alvara, and
drew up before the portal of the great white Mission.
Rafael lifted Angela Bryton from the saddle first of
all, and then with his own hand opened the door of the
carriage for Doña Maria.</p>

<p>"My house is your own, señora," he said, with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
debonair grace so charmingly his own. "I claim the
privilege of carrying the child through the door myself.
Doña Raquel will be here on the instant, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>The padre, pipe in mouth, had been watching the
arrival from his own door, but he drew nearer, and
smiled grimly at Doña Maria as he interrupted
the young man.</p>

<p>"Not quite on the instant, Don Rafael," he
remarked. "The Doña Raquel is well on her way to
San Joaquin ranch with Doña Ana Mendez. They
rode good horses, and they started this evening, a few
minutes before my own return."</p>

<p>The child in Rafael's arms uttered a little cry. He
had suddenly gripped her very tightly indeed, and a
strange Spanish oath broke from his lips. The priest
smiled, and the florid face of Don Eduardo flushed
angrily.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you sent Victorio Lopez&mdash;" he began,
but Rafael gave him one silencing look, and stepped
forward, offering his hand to Doña Maria.</p>

<p>"Will you honor my house by accepting it during
your stay, señora?" he asked, smilingly. "My
wife has not received the message that you would
arrive this week. Sickness at the ranch, or some
accident, has no doubt called the Doña Ana there,
and Raquel would not let her go alone. But our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
house and my service are at your feet. Will you
enter?"</p>

<p>There was not a moment's hesitation on the part
of Doña Maria. Let her English husband feel as he
might, she meant to enter the doors where only the
most exclusive had been entertained, since the day of
the new chatelaine had dawned. Raquel Estevan de
Arteaga was too well bred to make a scene when she
returned and found them there, and Doña Maria had
too much of the blood of Mexican gamblers in her
veins not to be willing to take all chances when
she wanted a thing very much.</p>

<p>As to the fact that her host and her charmingly
troublesome guest would be thrown together even
more than in the south, it did not trouble her in the
least. Even the bishop could not blame her for what
occurred in the house of Raquel Arteaga! Let that
lady stay at home and guard her own husband. And
if she failed,&mdash;well, it might be well to have some of
that cold, Indian-like pride of hers lowered.</p>

<p>The Doña Angela said nothing, only smiled a little,
and pretended to understand none of the Spanish
spoken, but the padre, watching her wide childish
blue eyes, and her rosebud of a mouth, noticed also
the one quick birdlike glance she flung toward Rafael,
and felt, like Doña Maria, that the stubborn pride of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
Raquel Arteaga was at last to be lowered a little. She
had been as an eagle swimming in the blue above all
their heads, but this petite, golden-headed ladybird
would sip more of honey from the blossoms of life,
and touch more closely an Arteaga!</p>

<p>And when, after the very gay supper in the old
refectory, Rafael brought a mantilla for Doña Angela,
that its lacy film might protect her from the soft air of
the starlight, the padre poured an extra glass of wine
for the Doña Maria, the Don Eduardo, and himself,
and held them in discussion. Fernando and Juanita
and the other young people could go along and show
the Doña Angela how beautiful were the arches and
corridors after the sun was gone, but they, the older
people, were content with the shelter of adobe walls
after the night fell.</p>

<p>So they wandered forth, Fernando with a guitar,
that the end of a perfect day should be celebrated in
love-songs; and as he protested that they sounded
better at a distance, he and Juanita strayed off into
the night.</p>

<p>Doña Angela and Don Rafael, from a throne of
sculptured stars and circles, suns and crescents,&mdash;all
the Aztec symbols of light,&mdash;listened to the passion
expressed in "El Tormento de Amor" floating
down to them from the tiled roof of the corridors,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
and later, when the doors were closed on the girls for
the night, those two still listened together to the
musical cadence of "Vengo à tu Ventana" sung under
barred windows, and to other harmonies never written
in music, but known as a compelling power to the
tempestuous heart of the Mexican. Under the stars
of that night, the butterfly was made to feel that the
beautiful tiger she had at first paraded as a trophy
was not to be laughed at,&mdash;never any more! And
even when the dawn broke, she lay wide-eyed behind
the iron bars of her window, wordless and frightened,&mdash;a
magician who had raised a spirit stronger
than her power to subdue. What a trifle it had been
at first,&mdash;a mere flirtation for the sake of his handsome
eyes, and now&mdash;</p>

<p>She told herself over and over that it was Keith
Bryton's fault, and that wooden Mexican woman's
fault. Why had she barred her out and raised the
aggressive spirit in her? It was not in the beginning
that she really meant to take her husband. And why
should Keith betray his indifference in the way he
did? It was so easy to show him that other men were
not indifferent. And oh, the awful dismal tragedy of
it! To think that by such a little, little chance she
had missed being legitimate queen over this most
royal domain!</p>

<p>&ldquo;After the Very Gay Supper&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
But that other woman, the Mexican, would hold it
all, always! Another woman might win Rafael's smile
and his love-songs, but the acres, the herds, the coin,
and the jewels (he had allowed Doña Maria to show
the latter to her guests that evening), all those things
would be held always in the slender strong hand of
Raquel Arteaga&mdash;Raquel Arteaga, who stood guard
over even his soul, lest the heretics&mdash;</p>

<p>Then she smiled a little to herself, an involuntary
smile of triumph. Had he not said in the dusk of
the corridor last night that his soul was at her feet?
With that battle won from the intolerant Mexican
girl, were the jewels and the coin out of reach? Had
he not said a boat left no track on the ocean,&mdash;the
boat he had sworn to find a harbor for,&mdash;sworn to?</p>

<p>Of course it was only a fleeting fancy, but it drifted
across her brain as a sort of solace for her fretful,
feverish rebellings against the uneven division of
things, and it served its purpose, for she was at last
lulled into slumber by the dream, though of course
it was only a dream.</p>

<p>But dreams, when dreamed by two, suggest such
alluring possibilities!</p>

<p>It was two days later, before the
sun was high, that Raquel Arteaga
rode into the plaza, and,
slipping from her horse, walked
directly into the little private
chapel and closed the door.
From the other wing of the corridor
Doña Maria and Doña Angela saw her, and exchanged
startled glances. Their hostess had arrived,
and had not even cast her eyes in their direction.
They were both relieved when Rafael and Señor
Downing emerged from the portal of the patio.</p>

<p>"Ah, she has arrived&mdash;my wife," remarked Rafael
as he noticed her saddle-horse nibbling at the geraniums.
"I sent an Indian messenger this morning.
He has been quick; and, Santa Maria! so has she.
Look at the horse!"</p>

<p>The animal was dripping, and as an Indian boy removed
the saddle the water ran down his sides and
made little pools in the dust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
"That will do him good," said Rafael. "Rub him
well, and he will look like black satin. And the
Doña Raquel is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your wife went to her own chapel; she saw no
one," observed Doña Maria. "I should go in, but if
she is at prayers&mdash;"</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a href='images/p320p.jpg'>
	<img src='images/p320w.jpg'
	title='Their Hostess had Arrived' alt='Their Hostess had Arrived' />
</a>
<p>&ldquo;Their Hostess had Arrived&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>If she had been, her prayers were ended, for as they
spoke she opened the door and came out on the corridor.
She was more pale than Rafael had ever seen
her, and without greeting to anyone, she spoke.</p>

<p>"Rafael, two men have been hurt in the mountain,
a priest and&mdash;the American who was missing from the
vigilantes. I think&mdash;I understand that he saved the
life of the padre&mdash;and both were hurt, and&mdash;they are
bringing him here."</p>

<p>"The American? You mean Keith Bryton?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I mean Keith Bryton," she said, steadily.
"I rode ahead. Ana is coming with them; she thinks
he is very ill&mdash;and the padre also was hurt&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Keith!" cried Doña Angela, sharply. "He is
hurt&mdash;and coming here&mdash;<i>here</i>?"</p>

<p>"There was no place else to send them," said
Raquel, quietly. "There has always been room in the
Mission for the sick or wounded&mdash;and in this case&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is right," exclaimed Rafael, with nervous
approval; "that is all right. Where should Señor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
Bryton go but where his friends are? This is his
sister, Señora Bryton. It is well she is here; sick men
need their own women folks about them. Raquelita,
thou art white as the lilies in the garden! Get you
some wine while I see to beds for the sick. It was
lucky you and Ana chanced to meet them. When
did Tomás reach you with the letter?"</p>

<p>She did not reply. Doña Maria was also asking
questions, and telling her the Padre Andros had gone
again to San Luis Rey for a week, and the three
women entered the dining-room, leaving Rafael's
question unanswered. He supposed that Raquel
and Ana had ridden south at his bidding, and was
elated that she had received the Doña Maria and her
guest as she had&mdash;without gladness, of course, but
without signs of displeasure. He divined there was
a white devil of rage under her calm exterior, but that
made no difference so long as she showed no outward
sign of it. Evidently she had accepted the fact that
he meant to be master; after that, life would be easier
in Capistrano. He had always been a bit resentful of
Keith Bryton's attitude toward himself. Never since
that dictatorial letter to San Pedro had he felt easy
with him, and there was no doubt whatever that Bryton
had avoided him since his marriage. But he forgot all
that in the satisfaction of the news Raquel brought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
With Bryton ill in the house, there was every reason
why the one woman of his family should remain under
the same roof indefinitely. It would mean the breaking
down of barriers against heretic invaders, and so
well content was Rafael over all this that he meant to
nurse Keith Bryton as the most valuable friend the
fates could send him. Elated with this idea, he called
Don Eduardo, and together they rode out to meet
them, and at sight of them wondered that even
Raquel's cool exterior had not been more ruffled at the
situation: she had given them no idea of what to expect.</p>

<p>"Your wife, in the cause of humanity, will allow
dying space for a heretic," observed Don Eduardo,
dryly, "but she evidently thinks them worth little
attention. The man looks worse than she led us to
think. We should have brought Indios and a litter
to meet them."</p>

<p>Keith Bryton, with his head bound up so as to be
almost unrecognizable, was tied on his horse and supported
by the left arm of a bearded priest who rode on
one side; while Doña Ana rode on the other, white-faced
and tremulous, as she recognized the two men
approaching.</p>

<p>"For the love of God, be cautious&mdash;cautious!" she
whispered to the priest. And the latter drew the hood
of his habit lower over his brows, to shut out the sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
"Softly, Anita mia! From this moment I am under
a vow of silence. This heretic and I have come out of
the shadow of death together, he with a broken head
and I with a broken arm. You can send your friends
to see where three men are still unburied in the
Trabuco hills. I ask of the Mission only time for
silent meditation until my preserver, here, is better&mdash;or
dead. I leave the words of it to you. From the
moment help comes I have vowed silence. Come,
come, Anita, girl. When we have blinded a woman
like Raquel Arteaga for two days and nights, we need
fear no eyes of men."</p>

<p>And it was so. The condition of the two men was
warrant of Ana's recital that three refugees of Flores's
bandits had assaulted the priest, with the idea that he
was of the vigilantes. When the Americano, by some
chance, had taken a short cut across the ranges, and,
hearing shots, had gone to the rescue, he found one
man with a broken arm keeping his enemies at a
distance with one of their own guns. He had
stumbled on their camp while they slept. For the
rest, Ana asked Rafael to send some one to bury
the three bodies. They were too near the trail to be
left like that, and would frighten horses when one
rode that way.</p>

<p>Of the padre, who, relieved of his burden, had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
quietly fallen in the rear, Doña Ana told that he was
a travelling monk from Mexico, who had been
entertained at the San Joaquin ranch, and had assisted
the Don Keith to quell a crazy uprising there. He
was under a vow of silence from the moment God
sent help; and&mdash;and of course there was room for
him at the Mission, not with the crusty old Padre
Andros, but if Rafael and Raquel would allow him a
private corner, undisturbed! He did not appear to
be the sort of man for Padre Andros's game-cocks
and monte games.</p>

<p>Rafael, glancing at the sallow, bearded face under
the monk's hood, decided that she was right. The
padre looked like a man given to vigils and fasts, one
living the life of renunciation such as one heard of
from the older records of the valley, before the secular
priests had been let loose upon the land to fatten,
while the parish drifted from faith.</p>

<p>"Padre Andros has been called to San Luis Rey;
it will be a week until he returns. This man&mdash;what
is his name? Libertad? That is very Mexican.
Well, the Mission is his; he can pray where he
chooses. God send he prays Don Keith well again.
Santa Maria! but he has a fever! Does he know
one?"</p>

<p>Ana shook her head. He certainly did not know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
her, and he did not know the padre, and she felt a
hesitation in telling him that the only one whose voice
or hand quieted the occasional ravings of the American
was that of his own wife. If she had done so, Rafael
would have only thought it a great joke on Raquel,
who avoided heretics. All the hours of the days and
nights in the hills, Raquel Arteaga had moved like a
woman in a dream, walking alone when she was not
praying beside Keith Bryton's couch of pine boughs.
While Ana slept the sleep of exhaustion that first
night, the silent priest had gone again and again to
see Bryton and hear if there was aught to do, and
each time that girl was crouching there, white-faced as
a spirit in the light of the waning moon, while the
man on the couch moaned "Espiritu! Doña Espiritu
mia!"</p>

<p>That was the one moan he had made since the
fever had struck him, and there had been no way of
quieting him. But that night, when the moans grew
into cries, the silent priest saw the girl listen until she
could bear it no longer, and then she went closer to
him and knelt there, her hands clasped tightly behind
her, and in them the golden beads of a rosary shone
against her black dress.</p>

<p>"I am here, close beside you," she said, lowly,
"always beside you in spirit&mdash;always!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
"Espiritu mia!" he muttered, and then with a
great sigh of relief sank into slumber.</p>

<p>The priest watched the girl to see what manner of
woman might be this daughter of a nun, whose father
had been the gay, lawless, debonair Felipe Estevan,
of whom wild stories had been told in the old days.
When had he ever resisted a love appealing? The
man watching her knew the girls of Mexican California
too well to doubt what the result would be: the
lover first, and the rosary and the prayers afterwards.</p>

<p>But the night waned, and the pale moon, facing the
morning star, saw her still crouching there against
the tree trunk. Ana thought she slept, but her
husband's enemy, who had watched her through the
night, knew better. He drew Ana aside, and gave
her warning.</p>

<p>"Tell Felipe Estevan's daughter nothing. I am
the priest; that is all. She is not the woman to think
this justified," and he touched the monk's robe.
"This night I heard her prayers when she thought
no one listened; and, Anita, girl, forget all crazy
things I said about Rafael's wife helping me to
revenge."</p>

<p>"You said nothing about Rafael's wife," and Ana
faced him with startled eyes. "You said&mdash;what was
it you said? Oh, that Keith Bryton should help
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
you&mdash;Keith Bryton, and his love for a woman who was a
saint."</p>

<p>As she spoke, the full meaning of his words burst
upon her, and she uttered a low cry of dismay.</p>

<p>"Barto! Holy God!&mdash;<i>Barto</i>!" she whispered.</p>

<p>But he caught her wrist, and his voice had a note
of command in it.</p>

<p>"Silence! She may hear you. Forget the fool
things I said there at the San Joaquin ranch. I
thought I knew something of Keith Bryton, but
I was mistaken. I thought I knew much of woman,
but one girl at her prayers last night changed all that.
We will nurse him well again, if your friends do not
murder me, and then I will get him away. Some day
when you and I have left all this behind us, I may
tell you what I thought I knew, but not now."</p>

<p>"But Raquel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Raquel will always be first of all the wife of
Rafael Arteaga; after that she may show kindness to
other human things, even the heretics. But this one
heretic we will take the care of off her hands all that
we can, Anita. She is not the girl to drag into a
man's schemes of revenge."</p>

<p>"I think she bewitches you each time she comes
near you," flashed Ana, resentfully. "On all other
things you talk to me sense, but when it is Raquel,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
my one friend, you talk riddles always, and you make
me feel as if I were walking beside her in the dark or
blindfold. What is it you mean? That Bryton
thinks of her? How could that be, when they have
not met? She thought until last night that he was
married, so little interest in him has she. How do
you get such crazy things in your head?"</p>

<p>"That is true. I find they are crazy things; I
confess it to you, and ask you to give no heed to my
mistakes."</p>

<p>"It was a mistake, then, that he cared?" persisted
Ana. "You were so sure&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was another woman," broke in the priest,
curtly. "Oh yes, there was a woman; but I was the
fool when I thought I knew who the woman was;
that is all."</p>

<p>"And Raquel is not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Raquel Estevan de Arteaga is a woman men
should cross themselves when they mention," he said,
quietly. "She has a strength in her that is of God or
the devil; she brings it from her Indian hills of
Mexico, and I for one will be on the safe side and
treat it with respect."</p>

<p>"She has bewitched you, that is all," declared Ana;
but the man in the priest's robe drew her behind a
giant aliso tree and kissed her on the mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
"Perhaps so," he agreed; "but, my Anita, it is
only enough to make me pity the man she would
bewitch in a different way. God! If he knew that
she cared like that, his life would be a hell."</p>

<p>"Why not a heaven?" asked Ana, turning to the
care of the breakfast. "Raquel spoke beautifully of
a love like that last night,&mdash;a love in the inner court
of life, in sanctuary, where only one other soul could
kneel beside one; it was a love spiritual only."</p>

<p>"Only!" said the man, glancing toward the girlish
figure in the serape curled against the white bark of
the tree. "Only! Anita, girl, let us get the breakfast
and leave love to people who have not a price set
against their heads. As for that love of the inner
court of life, the sanctuary, Raquel still dreams the
dreams of a nun. Men and women of California are
of flesh and blood, and they do not love in that way."</p>

<p>Three days later, Keith Bryton
opened his eyes within the white
walls of a little room in the Mission.
The wooden shutters of
the barred window were open,
and all was still. A meadow-lark
called somewhere without,
and he could hear down the valley the beat of the surf
against the cliffs. A bearded priest sat in the window
reading a book, and a woman coming from the dining-room,
through the quaint old Moorish doorway stopped
suddenly with a quick-caught breath of fear as
his eyes opened at the rustle of her dress, and he
smiled at her with a great sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"Doña Espiritu!" he murmured. "I knew you
would come if I waited. Such a bad dream has been
with me! I thought I was back in California, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
you&mdash;ah! there were higher barriers around you than
the convent walls, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Doña Raquel stood motionless, with the little
earthen olla of spring water in her two hands. Her
face grew white, and she glanced at the man in the
window-seat. He raised a finger of warning to his
lips, and arose and came forward.</p>

<p>"You must not talk, Don Keith," he said, quietly.
"One cup of water, since the lady brings it to you,
and then to sleep again. Sleep is best."</p>

<p>"You were of the dream, too," muttered Bryton,
fretfully, "the bad dream. Espiritu mia! tell me it is
not true. I cannot think; my head&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tell him, Doña Espiritu," said the man with the
book. Then he gave her a glance of warning and
touched his temple significantly. She crossed the
room and placed the water beside him.</p>

<p>"What shall I tell you, Don Keith?" she asked,
softly. "I am sorry you have been so ill and the bad
dreams have come. This is Padre Libertad; he has
nursed you very well. We must all obey him and let
you sleep."</p>

<p>"But not to dream again," he protested. "Be
kind, as you were in the hills of the temple,&mdash;give me
your hand again,&mdash;then I will sleep without the hell
of dreams."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
At the command of the padre, she obeyed, and he
took her one hand in both of his and drew it across
his lips. A shudder passed over her at his touch,
and she rested her other hand against the whitewashed
wall for support.</p>

<p>"Courage, my daughter," said the man with the
book, gently; and the man on the bed looked at him
and smiled.</p>

<p>"Courage?" he said. "You should have seen her
when she faced that mob of Indians and saved us.
We had not meant to spy on their ceremonies, and
we paid dearly for getting lost in the wilderness.
Still, it was worth it, Doña mia! It was worth going
through it all, even the hell of dreams, to find you
again like this, and your hand in mine."</p>

<p>She did not speak, only turned imploring eyes on
the padre.</p>

<p>"You need not mind him," continued Bryton. "I
like him better than the old padre, and he shall marry
us when I come back. Now I can go to sleep."</p>

<p>He held her hand in his, and when she tried to draw
it away, he smiled with closed eyes, and whispered,
"You remember how we watched all the stars cross
the sky? And then the morning star, the star of the
Holy Spirit, that was yours, Doña mia; and then&mdash;then&mdash;you
remember all&mdash;all of our one night?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
"All of it&mdash;always!"</p>

<p>He smiled with his eyes still closed, and released
her hand, and did not see her as she swayed toward
the door and was caught in the strong arms of the
man she called Padre Libertad. When she knew
where she was again, she found her face and hair wet
with cold water, and all the women about with cordials
and cures.</p>

<p>"It is a fever; she will get it next," prophesied
Doña Maria. "A woman who neither eats nor sleeps
gets ready for the graveyard."</p>

<p>But Raquel waved aside all their cures and sent for
Padre Libertad.</p>

<p>"You broke your vow of silence there just now for
him," she said, abruptly. "Break it now for me. You
know?"</p>

<p>"God help you, Raquel Estevan! I know. No one
else ever shall, and whatever you want done shall be
done."</p>

<p>"God help me, indeed!" Raquel moaned. "To
the soul of Rafael I am bound all the days of my life.
I want nothing done. I dare want nothing."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Raquel went no more into the room where Keith
Bryton awoke to a hold on life and reason,&mdash;that was the
one thing perplexing to the man in the priest's gown;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
and not even Ana was allowed to hear the constant
demands for Doña Espiritu, or the girl of the temple,
or the lady who had led him out of the wilderness
under the light of the morning star! All those things
would have seemed like maddest ravings to any but
Padre Libertad, who carefully excluded all visitors
from the room, despite the protests of Doña Angela,
who claimed the privilege of relationship,&mdash;a claim
denied by a shake of the head of the silent, book-reading
padre.</p>

<p>Raquel moved almost as silently about the corridors
of the Mission, serene, quiet, and busy, always busy
with the entertainment of her numerous guests. The
people of the country rode on any pretext to San Juan
in those days, to meet the Downings and talk by the
hour in the cool shadows of the patio concerning the
tragedies of the bandits. The beautiful old Mission
town had gained a new sort of fame through them.</p>

<p>Rafael arranged barbecues and picnics to the cañons,
where the wild-rose thickets were yet odorous with
bloom. Even a dance was arranged by some of the
gentlemen in the old wing of the Mission, called the
travellers' room,&mdash;a Spanish dance at which only
those wearing the old Spanish costumes dared keep
time to the music, and the Mexican serape was discarded
for the velvet cloak or cape of grander days.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a href='images/p334p.jpg'>
	<img src='images/p334w.jpg'
	title='And&mdash;He was an Arteaga!' alt='And&mdash;He was an Arteaga!' />
</a>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;He was an Arteaga!&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
The younger men rode fifty miles for costumes.
Don Juan Alvara, who still wore knee-breeches,
stockings, and buckled shoes, had promised to go to
bed earlier that night because of the demand on his
wardrobe. Raquel delved in old chests of Doña
Luisa Arteaga's belongings, and brought out treasures
of embroideries and brocades enough to turn the heart
of Angela Bryton bitter with envy. She knew
Raquel would look a barbaric queen in the jewelled
bodices where topazes formed the hearts of yellow
roses, or real pearl-embroidered lilies, and in laces&mdash;laces
to wrap her like a mummy, leaving only those
great violet eyes of hers visible to gaze in that serene
haughty way at one, and through one!</p>

<p>But once having been forced by circumstances to
take the hand of a guest in hers, Raquel Arteaga
raised no material barriers to hospitality.</p>

<p>"They are at your pleasure, Señora Bryton," she
said, graciously. "After you have selected what you
would like, Carmella and Juanita may care for some
of them. The white brocade of the lilies would
become you. There is a white mantilla of lace to go
with it, and pearls&mdash;plenty of pearls."</p>

<p>Doña Maria and Teresa Arteaga exchanged glances.
They had never objected to the favorites of their
husbands,&mdash;no good wife did,&mdash;but even the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
devoted of Mexican wives had never opened her
jewel-box for her rival.</p>

<p>However, they decided in confidence that Raquel
had appeared strange and indifferent since the day of
the fainting spell. She was more kind and gentle, if
anything, to Rafael himself, even tender in little cares
for his comfort, as his own mother might have been.
But beyond the tender, conciliating, half-maternal
attitude toward her husband, she walked as in a dream
of indifference toward the rest of the world. Full of
care as a hostess, she yet spent no moment alone with
any guest except the silent padre, who paced the
corridors, his eyes on a book, and always on guard at
the door of the American, who had almost given his
life that an unknown priest might live.</p>

<p>Rafael himself did not understand Raquel's gentle,
devoted attitude. Once, as he smoked in the corridor
facing the sea and commented aloud on the charms
of a pretty girl who crossed the plaza, some man,
standing there, took up the subject and spoke of his
wife&mdash;Rafael's&mdash;and the lucky fellow he was to get
her,&mdash;that girl of the South with her strange, alluring
beauty not to be defined, but so surely felt by all
who had the happiness to meet her. As Rafael
listened, he, for a moment, felt again a delight in the
barbaric sense of possession of her. It was true; she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
was of strange beauty, and he knew every man envied
him. The thought of it brought back the remembrance
of the fitful passion she had aroused in him
there in Mexico, where the bars of the convent had
made more keen his desire for victory. Some echo
of that fitful passion sent him from the man in the
plaza to the door of her room. It was not love;
but she was his, and&mdash;he was an Arteaga!</p>

<p>The shadowy room was lit by the soft glow of
candles on the altar of the Virgin. She had knelt
there until some wave of feeling swept over her,
leaving her prostrate at the feet of the serene, tender,
changeless Mother of Sorrows. For a moment he
halted, but the brandy he had been drinking was
of the best. The Doña Angela had gone bathing
with the others on the beach, while he had been kept
in the town by some business, and a man must console
himself. He remembered that he had won this girl,
whom others found beautiful, from one altar there in
the South; it gave a certain zest to his present determination.
A woman could pray at any time; but
just now&mdash;well, she should remember she was his!</p>

<p>What he said he did not clearly remember afterwards;
but he was strong, and he had been silent, and
she was gathered in his arms and lifted to her feet,
and he was seeking her lips with his, when, with a cry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
that was terrible in its smothered rage, she wrenched
herself free and darted to the table where the jewel-box
lay open, and on the top of strings of pearls
shone the glittering steel of a dagger. What she said
to him turned him, sullen and cowed, toward the door.
But there she stopped him.</p>

<p>"Your child, and the mother of it there in the
willows, are my care, Rafael Arteaga, as they would
have been the care of your mother, had she lived. I
have sworn to that dying mother to live beside you,
and guard you from what harm I can, but if you still
take your marriage vows to the willows, you put aside
the sacrament of your marriage to me. Never again,
while you choose to live like that, must you cross to
me where this altar is. I guard your soul for your
mother, but by the Virgin, and by this cross on the
dagger, I will send you to account there where she is, if
you come to me like that again! I give my life to keep
my vow; but if you drive me to it, my soul may yet
have to pay in the other life for the loss of your own!"</p>

<p>As he stumbled out of the door he met the Padre
Libertad pacing the corridor, as usual, with his book.
He did not lift his eyes or speak, and Rafael passed
on sullenly, muttering an oath: each way he turned
in the Mission he met an altar or a priest!</p>

<p>Ana, coming through the portal of the inner court,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
met him there, and heard the oath, and was filled with
fear of a discovery so appalling that her woman's wit
left her, and she blundered and caught his arm and
questioned.</p>

<p>"But, Rafael, he has done nothing. That he was
at the door of Raquel is not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sure, it is not," he agreed, scoffingly. "But when
a man has a wife of his own,&mdash;even Raquel Estevan
de Arteaga,&mdash;he does not want a black gown and a
monk's cowl forever as her shadow."</p>

<p>They were outside the window of Keith Bryton,
and the words reached the ears of the man on the bed
there, and brought him reeling but determined to his
feet.</p>

<p>It was the first word reaching him by which he
could grasp at the reality of the life about him; all
the vague dreams were dashed aside by that name,
"Raquel Estevan de Arteaga." It cleared the visions
of the fever his nurse had feared to dispel too quickly,
and in one staggering flash he saw the truth: the
"dream" of the California life was no dream, it was
the real life to be met and fought again. Where was
he, that the voice of Rafael Arteaga dared ring with
such imperious directions? He reached the barred
window dizzily and leaned his head against the high
ledge. The world whirled about him for a moment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
and when it stopped and stood still, he again heard
the voice of Rafael, irritated this time into more
intolerant speech by some eager protest of Ana.</p>

<p>"Oh, ho! That is the man, is it? And he saved
her from Juan Flores that night? That is news&mdash;God
curse him!"</p>

<p>"Rafael!" and the woman's voice was full of horror.
"You are crazy with brandy; you do not know how
you speak. Go to your bed and sleep. That man
saved your name and your wife from disgrace, and
you have only curses for him in your mouth!"</p>

<p>"Basta! He may win seven heavens for aught I
care. But, name of God! sing no praises of him for
saving Raquel Estevan for me! She is not a woman,
Anita! Never a woman for a man who wants a wife.
By God, I think she is the devil turned saint; and
the man who carries her to the hills is my friend and
earns a herd of horses!"</p>

<p>"Santa Maria! You are mad over that other
woman, Rafael Arteaga. Every one sees it but Raquel;
and when she does see it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She! she sees nothing but her saints on the altar!
She has only the heart of a nun in that white breast
of hers. Don't you put your devil of a tongue in
this business, Ana Mendez, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are drunk, Rafael," said Ana, untouched by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
the personal remark. "You are drunk. Go to
bed."</p>

<p>No other words came to the ears of Keith Bryton.
He heard the departing steps, and the rustle of Ana's
silken gown on the tiling, and then someway he found
himself back in the bed, with all the cobwebs cleared
from his brain. He knew where he was now&mdash;in a
room of the Mission, where he had not dared set a
foot since the day when he heard her vow made to
the dying woman. He was in her home, then, the
home of her husband. And that silent padre who
had shielded him from knowing it&mdash;what did his
devoted guardianship mean? What did it mean that
he had approved that once she had come there and
stood by the bed with her hands in his? That she
had listened to his words, and&mdash;&mdash; Or was that also a
fancy born of the fever?</p>

<p>But when the silent padre came in and closed the
door, and heard the direct rapid questions, the replies
were just as direct. Padre Libertad observed that
the shock of the truth had come, and there was no
reason for further illusion. The American was weak,
but alert to all the padre told him; and he told him
all the truth.</p>

<p>"So you see, Señor Bryton, you saved my life, and
there is a good price set against it. I am here in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
home of my cousin, who will make a fiesta of the day
I am hung or shot. You know it, and the girl I love
knows it. It has been a good place to hide: they think
me in Mexico. I start there to-night, unless you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait: to-morrow I can perhaps go with you.
God! To think I have been helpless here in his
home!"</p>

<p>The other man said nothing, only watched him
with the dark velvety eyes full now of the spirit
of comradeship.</p>

<p>"It is strange it should be you I trust," he said,
at last. "I remember days when I planned which
way I would have you killed when my men found
you. You saved the government their horses last
year. I shot at you once as you rode from Santa
Ana ranch."</p>

<p>"Was that you?" observed the other. "Yes, I
remember." Then, after another silence, he asked
with careful indifference:</p>

<p>"Doña Raquel Arteaga&mdash;she was in here, and I
said things I&mdash;well&mdash;you heard! Does she know
the truth about you?"</p>

<p>"Not even does she suspect. No one here has
ever seen me since this beard is over my face. I pass
the men on the plaza who hunted me with hounds
and guns to the water's edge a year ago, and they bow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
their heads and lower their voices not to disturb my
devotions. Madre de Dios! it has been great sport,
but for the thought of&mdash;of a woman whose heart
has been shown to me as a priest! The thing I have
done is a sacrilege, and Father Andros would scorch
me well for it&mdash;but I would rather burn than have
her ever know the truth&mdash;I who am the lover of
another woman!"</p>

<p>Keith Bryton reached out his hand to the outlaw,
and there were no more words spoken between them
of the matter.</p>

<p>Later Doña Angela returned, and hearing from
Ana that Bryton was again conscious of his whereabouts,
insisted on seeing him; and this time the
silent padre of the prayers offered no protest, only
sat in the window-seat, and did not lift his eyes,
and listened.</p>

<p>"I've been wild&mdash;just that, Keith, ever since they
brought you back. Who? oh, Doña Raquel and
Ana, and, of course, the padre. My! You looked
awful. I'm glad you are better. There is to be
a really great Spanish dance, and I should have hated
to go unless you were out of danger. They would
not allow me inside this door before, and I&mdash;Keith,
there are a thousand things I want to say
to you, and&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
The priest arose and made a quiet movement toward
the door. The interview was evidently terminated.
Keith had not had a chance to say anything, and
Doña Angela whisked out of the room in a temper.
She sought Rafael, but could not find him, for the
reason that he had taken Ana's advice and tumbled
into bed. She finally found Ana and Raquel in the
dining-room, and smiled tolerantly at the fact that
the latter, covered with a great apron of linen, was
attending personally to the moulding of candles, and
not a servant, not even Ana, was allowed to help.</p>

<p>The days of Doña Angela's stay had brought
her face to face with many self-satisfying little scenes
of that sort. Remembering that first meeting of the
two as strangers, it was comforting to Angela to be
able to look down in some way on the wife of Rafael
Arteaga; and since she chose to make of herself a
servant&mdash;&mdash; It seemed so incredible to the woman who
had never, never, had all she wanted of luxury, that
this other girl, young, and many said handsome,
had not the natural woman's vanity for decking
herself with the gorgeous things stacked in those
old chests. To her it seemed a warrant to Rafael
to seek companionship elsewhere. A woman who
could claim a throne lessened her value by stooping
to the cares of the kitchen. It argued low tastes;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
it emphasized the uneven division of things. It was
a constant reminder to Angela Bryton that she, the
woman who appreciated it all, who would have held
a half-regal Court of Love in the old walls where
only endless prayers were whispered,&mdash;she was the
woman to whom it should belong by right. For her,
Rafael Arteaga would have spread carpets of velvet on
the tiled floors and cast himself, happy, at her feet.</p>

<p>All these thoughts had given her a sort of insolent
courage to comment on the girl who trod the
Mission-made bricks, and whose eyes looked out so
often over one's head.</p>

<p>"Of all the Indian servants, have you none trained
in so laborious a task as this?" she asked, sinking
into one of the rawhide-seated chairs at the table.
"It is horrid work. I wonder you spoil your hands."</p>

<p>Ana flashed a glance of resentment at the languid
blossom of a woman, always a shimmer of lacy ruffles,
a picture of alluring, half-childish helplessness. It
was for such a white kitten Rafael was losing all
his sense.</p>

<p>"I should be proud to use my hands for the
same work, instead of this endless embroidery," she
observed; "but Doña Raquel will not hear of it."</p>

<p>"To mould the candles for the altar, each woman
of each house should make her own," returned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
Raquel, quietly. "You have not that custom in
your land&mdash;no?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. We are not taught that extra
pounds of beef tallow will help to save our souls
if burned in silver holders."</p>

<p>"No? What, then, does it take to save souls
in your country?"</p>

<p>"Those who come here leave their souls at home
for safe-keeping," declared Ana, thrusting her needle
viciously into the embroideries of lawn; "they only
bring their long purses to be filled."</p>

<p>For one moment the snapping black eyes of Ana met
the childish blue ones of Angela and carried in their
glance an accusation and understanding. Angela's pretty
teeth closed with a vicious click under her red lips,
then she shrugged her dimpled shoulders, and laughed.</p>

<p>"Oh, you see of course only the merchants here,"
she conceded, "the people who buy hides, and tallow,
and herds of horses."</p>

<p>Then she turned again to Raquel, who had seen
some of the little byplay.</p>

<p>"And those candles of purest white, packed in scented
cotton, for what especial purpose are they reserved?"</p>

<p>"They are the candles for the dead."</p>

<p>Angela shuddered, as with a passing chill.</p>

<p>"How constantly you people keep before you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
remembrance of the tomb!" she exclaimed. "One
needs to get out in the sun often to remember that
the old Mission is not really a vault."</p>

<p>"It is," said Ana; "there are padres of the old
days buried under some of the floors."</p>

<p>"How perfectly horrid! And you make all those
dozens of immaculate candles to be used for whoever
comes first," she continued, addressing herself to
Raquel, with a slight smile of disdain as at a childish
pastime; "and they are all duly blessed, I suppose,
and duly insured to light the souls from the path
of the inferno."</p>

<p>For the first time Raquel perceived the touch of
malice under the smiling query.</p>

<p>"You are right," she said, quietly; "those are of the
first I ever made with my own hands here in San Juan
Capistrano. Padre Sanchez bestowed on them his
blessing, and the thought of so holy a man is in
itself a blessing."</p>

<p>"But think," persisted the soft little malicious
tones, "is it not often the story of the pearls and the
swine? Any sodden drunken Indian beast is likely
to be laid in state with those emblems of purity burning
in his honor."</p>

<p>Raquel paused with the last handful of them, and the
violet eyes, dark with indignation, met the blue ones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
"That is true," she said, coldly. "We are taught
that souls are all alike before God. These in my hand
may be lit for any one&mdash;for a sodden beast that dies
in sin, for a murderer, for me perhaps, or it may be
they burn even for you, señora!"</p>

<p>"Ugh! how ghastly!" The blue eyes wavered, and
she arose with a little shiver. "But I don't think I
would want them, really," she added, as she was leaving
the room, "any more than I would want masses
said if I should go under a breaker some day when
bathing, and never come up again. The fashion of
the living praying for the dead seems a bit incongruous
and amusing. Save the candles for those of
the faith, Doña Raquel."</p>

<p>Her little mocking laugh made more pointed her
intention of ridicule. The face of Raquel was still and
expressionless, as she slowly placed the last of the
candles in the perfumed box and closed the lid. Ana
flung down her embroidery, and said to Raquel, with
blazing eyes:</p>

<p>"Raquelita! Some day I shall choke that pretty
little white devil, you will see! How and why we
endure her mocking I don't know. That she is of
Keith Bryton's family is something, but it is not
enough. When he is able I shall tell him some
things&mdash;I shall tell Don Eduardo things! She makes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
a mock of our women, and I keep quiet; she makes
her love to your husband, and I say nothing; but,
Raquel, she makes mockery of your religion in your
own house. Can you stand that too?"</p>

<p>Raquel put her hands over her eyes an instant in a
tired way.</p>

<p>"Quiet, you, Anita mia," she said after a little.
"Words are not so much use. They will go away
soon now&mdash;after the dance to-morrow night. And I
do not think it is true of Rafael. He is her caballero,
as he would be yours or Juanita's; that is all.
There is that other woman in the willows. She&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Raquelita, how little you know men! Pretty
Marta by the river is only a servant; but our men go
mad for these white women of blue eyes&mdash;mad!"</p>

<p>"A few days more, and that will be forgotten as he
would forget the brown girls. Have patience. At
least, she will not mock our religion to him; and
the rest&mdash;it is only one day and two nights more,
Anita, and you will help me."</p>

<p>"At least you will find a way to keep those pearls
from her," insisted Ana, stubbornly. "How could you
offer them to her? Oh, I could have screamed at you!"</p>

<p>"The pearls are but a trifle to let go for a night,
dear. Help me with the candles to the altar-place.
Oh, yes, she may have the pearls."</p>

<p>Angela Bryton sought until
she found Rafael asleep in a corner
of the travellers' room.</p>

<p>"Ana Mendez knows; she
has told your wife," she said,
abruptly. "Two nights and a
day we have; that is all. Raquel
says I am not more to you than a brown girl in the
willows. You make her pay for that!"</p>

<p>"Pay?" He rubbed the sleep of the brandy from
his eyes and sat up, then caught her to him in the
instinct of possession.</p>

<p>Quickly she drew aside and eluded him.</p>

<p>"Not yet," she said, with the glint of steel in
her eyes. "Not until you make her pride pay,
Rafael mio! She tosses a string of pearls to me as a
queen would to a waiting-maid, to show how trifling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
a thing it is to her. One string! Rafael, where now
is that boat?"</p>

<p>"The boat?" He stumbled to his feet and stared
at her.</p>

<p>"The boat! You said it. Not even my hand
shall you touch until it is in the harbor. Cousin
Eduardo and Keith Bryton will send me away when
she tells them; they will never let you see me again."</p>

<p>"Huh!" He flung back his head contemptuously.
He had never quite gotten away from Teresa's
conviction that Keith Bryton's impatience with Angela
was born of jealousy. So it was Keith Bryton again!</p>

<p>"He gets you when he has killed me, not sooner,"
he muttered. "And they all know, eh? How is that?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, but they will. It is that Mendez
woman and your wife! I will <i>not</i> be sent like a pauper
back to England! Cousin Edward spoke yesterday
of that; of an allowance for Dolly and me. Now
I know what it means! If I go, I will go in a manner
they don't dream of,&mdash;alone in that boat! You can
join me anywhere you say, on the coast. How you
stare! It is not so difficult, and there will never,
never, never be any other way we can be together."</p>

<p>"That is true; we will go."</p>

<p>"You want all the coin; you want the jewels; you
want&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
"I want only you," he said.</p>

<p>"If you want me, you must give me what I ask.
Those women must not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To hell with the women! We will go, and no
one need guess we have gone together. I will send
Victorio with a letter to San Pedro for a boat.
Your lips for that promise!"</p>

<p>"When the boat is in the harbor, and the jewels in
my hand, Rafael," she replied, and darted like a bird
through the door, and out into the garden. Later
she came into the refectory with an armful of lilies,&mdash;symbols
of innocence,&mdash;and asked Ana for an olla for
them, and was very demure and sweetly appealing for
the rest of the day.</p>

<p>What Padre Libertad saw or
heard he did not particularize.
But when Keith Bryton, the
day of the Spanish dance, had
arisen and dressed, and talked a
little with all those known to
him in the Mission, except the
mistress of it, the bearded priest closed the door on
them all, and came and sat beside him.</p>

<p>"To-morrow, my friend, we go," he said.</p>

<p>"Can I&mdash;will she speak to me&mdash;once?"</p>

<p>"What is there to say to a woman like that? God!
To think that such a one should be Rafael Arteaga's
wife!"</p>

<p>"No," agreed the other; "there is nothing to be
said. Only I would like to see her face once, even
though she should not know it. Could that be?"</p>

<p>"It is not wise; it sends you away with more of
a heartache; but there is one place she goes each
evening as the stars come out. There is one saint
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
left in one niche of the old ruin. Since she rode
with us from the hills, flowers are always there,
and she goes from her own chapel there&mdash;to pray,
perhaps. She has not said so, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can see her there. Will you&mdash;will you try to
manage that no one else comes? Oh, it will be brief
enough, even if we speak. But the statue in the
niche&mdash;I can't remember."</p>

<p>"It is in the shadow. The draperies of red are
very faded, and so is the gilt of the embroideries now.
Once it was very gorgeous, and it is called Maria
Madalena."</p>

<p>Keith turned on the speaker with flaming eyes.</p>

<p>"She kneels there to pray&mdash;<i>she</i>? What mad
fanaticism is that? Good God, man! <i>she</i> is the
soul of innocence!"</p>

<p>"What she knows of her own heart, she knows,
my friend. This is not the thing to tell a man who
is to her what you are; but there is&mdash;there may be
some day, a thing that will leave her free; and if it
come&mdash;"</p>

<p>Keith had covered his face with his hands. The
weakness of the illness was still on him; he durst not
leave his eyes unguarded. But after a little he looked
up.</p>

<p>"You know something more?" he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
"I know there is another woman who has Rafael
tied hand and foot; I know she will take him away;
the only thing I do not know is how long it will last.
The bishop himself would help such a separation."</p>

<p>"God himself could not," said Keith, "unless he
kill Rafael Arteaga. When I heard what he said of
her outside the window, I was tempted to kill him
with my own hand. Nothing else would free her; I
heard the oath she took!"</p>

<p>"To send to eternity the soul she is vowed to guard
would not free her from the idea. If he should die
suddenly, unshriven, it is a lost soul, just the same."</p>

<p>"It is the maddest fanaticism to bind a child like
that to such a hell; and she accepts it, as&mdash;as her
people in the past accepted the order for sacrifices."</p>

<p>"What do you know of her people?"</p>

<p>"What do you?"</p>

<p>The two men looked into each other's eyes for a
moment, and then Padre Libertad spoke:</p>

<p>"I saw her mother years ago in Mexico. I was
only a boy, and I adored Estevan. I carried letters
for their love-making. That helps me to understand
their daughter. It is true; it is in the blood, and
you must go, my friend, before worse happens. And
if ever she should be free&mdash;"</p>

<p>Keith put out his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
"Don't tempt me with a hope like that! I want
to be sane when I do see her!"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>He saw Doña Angela first, a delightful vision of
brocades and white mantilla. She had dressed early,
that she might help to receive the guests.</p>

<p>She flinched a little under his keen glance as his
eyes wandered from the pearl-trimmed bodice to the
fair face.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course it is not mourning," she exclaimed,
"if that is what you are thinking of! But at least I
wear no color, and it is only for one night. I have
not the least intention of dancing. The whole affair
is only to show off the old costumes."</p>

<p>"You succeed very well," he remarked. "Let
Dolly come around to see me when she has had
supper. I leave early in the morning, and can't see
her then to say good-bye."</p>

<p>"So soon&mdash;going?" She tried to keep the delight
from her tone of surprise. He was the most unmanageable
man she had ever known. His indifference
had attracted her, even infatuated her, a year ago, but
there were days since when she thought she hated
him. "Yes, I will send Dolly. She loves you dearly,
more even than she did poor Ted."</p>

<p>"We will not discuss my brother," he said, coldly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
"But that will not prevent me caring for the child as
he would have done."</p>

<p>"Irrespective of her mother?" she asked, halting
in the door and looking over her shoulder at him.</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Or&mdash;or of anything I might offend you in?"</p>

<p>"Nothing you choose to do will affect my promise
to my brother," he said, impatient at her persistence.</p>

<p>"I may remind you of that some day," she said,
gathering up her brocades. "If you do go, I hope
that ghoul of a man, your padre, goes too. His
silence makes him more like a spook than a man.
The people have a holy horror of his piety."</p>

<p>After she had disappeared, Padre Libertad entered
from an inner room and smiled grimly at Bryton.</p>

<p>"You are the sort of lover to be unhappy," he
observed. "You can't console yourself with the other
women. Half the men in the valley are mad over
that woman, who would coquette with you if you
did not turn ice when she comes near."</p>

<p>Keith stared out of the window toward the hills
of the sea, tinged with the warm rose of the sunset.
And the man in a priest's robe tried to laugh, and
ended with a sigh.</p>

<p>"I admire your strength, though I doubt if I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
could emulate it," he confessed. "One pretty woman
in sight is worth a dozen goddesses over the hill."</p>

<p>"Talk sense if you can!"</p>

<p>"I can. I shall leave to-night instead of to-morrow.
I find I can go to Mexico, or South America if I
choose, without touching land. I shall be running
away with the property of a relative, and you might
not care to mix up with it."</p>

<p>"An hour ago you had no such plan."</p>

<p>"An hour ago I had not confessed Victorio Lopez!
I know an old record of his, and he thinks it is witchcraft.
There is a lot of coin going along,&mdash;a matter
of several rawhide sacks of it,&mdash;but it will be donated
by a man who can afford gifts. Let me have your
address two months ahead, and I can tell you how it
all turns out."</p>

<p>"You should be glad to get away alive, without
weighting yourself with coin. There is a woman here
who would care if things went entirely wrong."</p>

<p>"Ana? It is for her I take the chance. I know
a corner down the coast where fifty thousand will last
forever. She is free, and she is of California&mdash;no
snow of the hills in her blood! She will come to me
after the chase is over."</p>

<p>"She knows?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. Women's fears upset things sometimes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
If I do not tell her, it will be better. I need only
tell that I am going; she is waiting eagerly for that."</p>

<p>"And Victorio Lopez?"</p>

<p>"He is paralyzed by the fear that I may give some
old proofs of things to the alcalde. Oh, Victorio is all
right. He knows two Indian sailors who will say
nothing. They need to get away, and want a chance.
We will bind and gag the others and put them ashore.
It is all settled. The saints be thanked that I know
boats and the coast!"</p>

<p>Bryton scarcely knew whether to think the plan a
wild fancy or an actual fact. The whole scheme of
life those days was so filled with the strange and
tragic, that all the echoes of laughter and the tinkle
of guitars in the corridors could not even temper it.</p>

<p>At sunset Rafael Arteaga rode a dripping horse into
the plaza, and shouted cordial responses to the chorus
of greetings awaiting him. All the day he had been in
the saddle. "On business," was the only explanation
to Don Eduardo and Doña Maria. To his wife he had
offered none, nor spoken since the scene in the chapel.
But he was in high good spirits, gay and eager.</p>

<p>He came direct to Bryton's room with a fine air of
delight that he was on his feet again. Even to Padre
Libertad, whom he had so fervently cursed the day
before, he was at last gracious. When told by Ana
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
that the padre was on his journey south either at once
or early in the morning, he gave her some gold pieces
to bestow upon him for his church or his order: priests
always had all sorts of ways to use money. Padre
Libertad accepted the alms gratefully, and exchanged
for them a blessing.</p>

<p>The sun was gone, and men, and women too, were
riding in from outlying ranches. The Indians and
Mexicans were trooping to the plaza to watch the gay
caballeros and dark-eyed ladies in the dresses of their
grandparents. Raquel Arteaga, dressed in simple black,
with white undersleeves and white chemisette of silk,
stood in the corridor for a while and greeted her earlier
guests, while her husband dressed. All the people were
on the west side of the plaza, where the dancing was to
be. Bryton could see her there surrounded by the gay
people, almost nunlike with the strings of black pearls
around her throat as sole ornament, and in the braids
of her hair the white stars of the odorous jasmine,
thrust there by Ana, to break the severity of her garb.
Her eyes burned like purple stars, and the pink color
crept, in spite of herself, to her cheeks, and stayed there.
Somewhere, she knew, one man was watching her, and
each moment the terror grew that some of their many
friends would bring him to her and make it impossible
for him to refuse to come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
Several times she caught the eyes of Ana regarding
her curiously. It was the first time she had ever seen
Raquel surrounded by men and bandying compliments,
and looking, for all her nunlike white and black, like a
royal creature at a puppet show. And Ana had a sort
of triumph in noting that the eyes of Doña Angela also
wandered to her hostess in a sort of petulant amaze at
the supremacy of her, when she chose to unbend and
radiate graciousness in that manner. For Raquel jested
and laughed at the pretty phrases of caballeros murmured
in her ear. She refused a brooch of emerald for
the Virgin in the chapel, in exchange for the jasmine in
her hair. She promised two men to say a rosary for
their aching hearts, and she allowed the older men to
kiss her hands. One looking at her said:</p>

<p>"You are Mexico come to life to-night, señora.
Always I have thought it. But to-night I see it with
my own eyes. Mexico has always that glory of the opal
fires at the heart."</p>

<p>Angela Bryton saw and heard, and her own childish
appeal appeared all at once cheap and of tinsel. The
pearls and brocades of the woman she hated seemed to
scorch her flesh, and she felt the truth of the petulant
words she had said to Rafael: that the pearls had been
tossed to her with the indifference of a queen. The
owner of the casket could afford to stand serene and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
gemless, with only the jasmine flower in her hair, and
yet dominate.</p>

<p>A cold rage filled her as she realized what Raquel
could mean to men if she cared. It would be as it was
when they met first on the hill, always she would hold
the middle of the road, if she was aroused to care. Up
to that moment there had been a wild fancy of perhaps
sailing away alone with the hastily gathered coin, and
of stopping at no port for Rafael. She was half afraid
of him and after all what could he do if she did elude
him like that? But the sight of Raquel and her little
court of admirers changed all that. The proud eyes
should know all the humiliation one woman could
cause another&mdash;all!</p>

<p>She looked for Rafael; at once she would tell him,&mdash;now,
while the glory of the Mexican opal eclipsed the
woman of the royal pearls! She was blind with anger
to every other thing. But he had not yet appeared.
He was dressing, and a gentleman came to claim her for
a dance. The guitars were already sending harmonies
through the open doors, and the people were gathering
thick along the western corridors. The rest of
the plaza and the inner court were deserted. Not
even a pair of lovers strayed from the crowd as yet.
Later, when the moon came up, they would gather
courage, but the shadows of the corridors seemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
eerie retreats at night to any but souls oblivious to the
world.</p>

<p>It was not night yet. The first star glimmered in
the western sky, and to the east a soft radiance over
San Juan Mountain marked the path where the moon
would come. In the warm dusk the woman with the
opal fires of Mexico in her heart slipped away from the
gay groups and through the stillness of the padres'
garden, under the sculptured face and serpent, and then
to the place of the altar, where the shadows were always
softest. She came swiftly, silently; she had an odd
feeling of being followed by his thoughts. The altar
was the one place of refuge surely&mdash;the altar!</p>

<p>But it was not. He stood there leaning against
the pillar. She carried a tiny candle and a rosary.
He watched her light other candles in the niche, thus
outlining the carved saint with the long hair over her
shoulders, and the draperies of crimson. Flowers
were there, blood-red roses, and he saw it all in the
soft glimmer of the candles; then, as she was about
to kneel before them, he strode forward and caught
her arm.</p>

<p>The golden rosary fell on the tiled floor between
them, and she placed her other hand over his, in
mute appeal.</p>

<p>"You shall not kneel at that altar," he commanded,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
his voice scarcely raised above a whisper; "that much
of you belongs to me. I will not go away from you
with that memory of you in my mind; I will not!"</p>

<p>She was trembling, and dared not lift her eyes.</p>

<p>"You should not have touched me," she said,
brokenly. "All those hours on the hill I did not
touch you even once. Must the two of us be weaker
than one?"</p>

<p>"Weak? Oh yes, I am weak to-night, or I should
not be here&mdash;the weakness of a sick man who cannot
help himself. It is the last time, Espiritu mia, so
long as we live&mdash;so long as we live!"</p>

<p>She slipped the Aztec ring from her finger and gave
it to him.</p>

<p>"I thought perhaps it was the ring that gave you
power over my thoughts," she said, simply; "but
it was not. Your heart beats here in my breast,
and will till I die, or till you do. Take it back,
keep it. After all, it was not the ring!"</p>

<p>Her voice was so low, so even, that he, hearing his
own heart-beats at the mere sight of her, felt the
sudden resentment of a sick man at what appeared
to be her cold control of herself.</p>

<p>"Is it so easy for you, then?" he asked. "Like
slipping a ring from your finger or a bracelet from
your wrist, and putting it aside to wear no more?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
Oh, God! If but for one minute you could know
aught but the sweet cool love of the girl, or the nun,
or the devotee!"</p>

<p>She caught her breath in a little shudder at the
heart-call in his words, then put out her hand and
looked at him as he had never seen her look.</p>

<p>"Don't touch me," she said, her tones tense with
a final decision. "You think that I do not know&mdash;that
I do not understand; yet you see me kneel
<i>there</i>!" and she flung one eloquent hand to the
Madalena of the roses. "It is the thought&mdash;the
thought! That we live on different sides of the world
will not change the fact that you live in me, and I in
you. And it will be always&mdash;always! I do not
understand? Yet I have locked my door at night
and flung the key through the bars of the window,
that I could not follow my heart and go to you
wherever you were! I do not understand? Yet
there have been days when I feared to mount my
horse to ride alone, for fear the wild wish for you
would grow stronger than I could bear, and I should
ride to you, to you only, and&mdash;oh, Mother of God!&mdash;ask
you to keep me there!"</p>

<p>Her voice broke in shuddering sobs, and she
covered her face with her hands, sinking on her knees
before the Madalena of the altar, the last crowned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
saint left in the ruin. Her one hand was still extended
to ward him off, but he caught it, held it, and
drew her to him.</p>

<p>"You are mine by all that!" he muttered, scarce
knowing what he said. "Do you think I shall leave
you here after knowing the truth? Espiritu! The
Indians named you rightly. Spirit of mine, there are
no bonds of earth strong enough to keep me from
you now. Come! Our world is together; the nights
of the evil dreams have been lived through. Somewhere
we shall find the sunshine."</p>

<p>The hand clasping hers she caught to her lips, but
when he would have clasped her, she broke from him
with a low moan of protest.</p>

<p>"I tell you this that you go away knowing that
the real life of me is with you always," she said,
and stood leaning against the altar of the saint. "Go
now, and go quickly; for I tell you truly, if the day
ever come again when I find myself like to follow
you, I will come where I am now, and this will
end it all."</p>

<p>From the bodice of her gown she drew the little
dagger she had taken from the jewel-casket the day
before.</p>

<p>"My life is not my own to live in my own way;
it is bound by an oath to the dead, and there is no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
release, none&mdash;none! Go now. You know my heart
and the madness of it. Forget me if you can,&mdash;but
oh, beloved, not too quickly!"</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<a href='images/p368p.jpg'>

	title='One Wordless Minute.' alt='One Wordless Minute.' />
</a>
<p>&ldquo;One Wordless Minute.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>He caught her to him and held her there. The
world reeled about them for one wordless minute,
and then he released her and walked out across where
the tower of the temple had once been, and he knew
he was leaving her forever. A horse was waiting.
He had said he could ride best in the moonlight,
and a little later the hoof-beats sounded through the
strumming guitars, and she knew it was over! It was
her sacrifice for the oath to the dead, and she sank
prostrate in the shadow of the altar. The tiny
candles glimmered and went out, yet still she lay
there. The moon in its soft yellow light flooded the
open space without, but did not touch her. She had
found the rosary and clasped it, her lips against
the cold pearl figure of the sculptured Christ.</p>

<p>And then two persons came toward her through
the arch of the old sacristy, one in the velvet and
gold lace of a Spanish grandee, and the other a shimmer
of brocade and pearl-gemmed lilies.</p>

<p>"No, I will not go without it," the woman's voice
was saying, petulantly, "not though a dozen boats
waited! Yes, I can slip away after the dance. Have
a horse ready. Dolly will be sleeping; she is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
greatest risk. But we can be out of sight of land
long before the dawn breaks."</p>

<p>The man murmured some plea in her ear, and she
turned away, shrugging her shoulders.</p>

<p>"The jewels first!" she said, with pretty decision.
"The coin is a matter of course; we shall need that to
live on. But the jewels&mdash;why not? Half of them
belonged to your own family, and for the rest&mdash;well,
you leave her enough to give the Church; that is all
she lives for. Bring me the jewels at once: when I
see them in my own hand, I am ready to promise
everything."</p>

<p>"You are not afraid to wait here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a little," she acknowledged. "It's a horrid,
creepy place, but it's the one corner where no one
else will come. I will wait for them here."</p>

<p>The woman prostrate before the Madalena arose
to her feet and stood motionless in the shadow. Her
hands were crossed unconsciously on her heart to
quiet its beating. Her own sacrifice, then, was to go
for nothing; the vow she had sworn to live for was to
count for naught because of one little white vampire
of a creature whose god was gold and jewels!</p>

<p>The crossed hands held the rosary and the dagger.</p>

<p>"They are here," said Rafael, returning after a few
minutes, "all but the few the girls wear to-night.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
There! They are at last in your own hands, and
now&mdash;"</p>

<p>She slipped her white arm about his throat and
kissed him on the mouth.</p>

<p>"And you will live in my way&mdash;not hers?" she
said, with clinging sweetness. "You are not to be
even Catholic with me? You have promised!"</p>

<p>"Thou art my only god, O little white one!" he
said, and pressed her to his breast. "All the world
can go to hell, so I have you! My soul I give into
these little hands; my heart is under these little feet,
which I kiss thus; and thus, and thus! Though
Christ himself stood in the way, I would have you
for myself!"</p>

<p>She laughed softly in her triumph.</p>

<p>"We shall be missed," she said at last. "Go that
way to the plaza, and I will go by the old garden.
These I will wrap up and carry in my own hands.
Go,&mdash;oh, there will be other nights for kisses,&mdash;go
now, quickly!"</p>

<p>She pushed him from her, and he obeyed, walking
across the tiled floor in the moonlight, and out into
the plaza, as Bryton had walked so short a time
before. The woman with the casket stood an instant
looking after him, and then raised the lid and lifted
a handful of the gems, holding them up that the soft
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
light of the moon might add to the glow of rubies
and the white fire of diamonds.</p>

<p>"All these, and his very soul besides!" she murmured,
holding a necklace aloft to the moon's rays,&mdash;"his
soul besides!"</p>

<p>And then a low strangled cry escaped her as the
woman of the rosary and dagger came silently to her
from the shadows and halted a moment beside her.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>A little later the Padre Libertad was stopped in
the corridor by Raquel. He had been watching the
dancers, and was about to start south. Like Bryton,
he meant to ride at night, instead of in the hot sun.</p>

<p>"Wait," she said, imperatively; "the chapel is
open; I would confess before you go."</p>

<p>"But to-morrow&mdash;your own padre&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To-night," she said; "and I want no other padre."</p>

<p>"If you have remembered a sin&mdash;" he began, hesitatingly;
but she interrupted.</p>

<p>"I think it is neither sin nor remorse," she said,
quietly; "but it is you that must listen to me."</p>

<p>He closed the door behind them. Old Polonia
crouched unnoticed beside it, and in perhaps ten
minutes he came out again, and started to walk
the road to the sea. Rafael saw him, and laughed at
the queer crack-brained padre who preferred walking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
to riding a good horse. Others laughed also, and the
dance went on, until the partners of Doña Angela grew
impatient, and a gay party with guitars started to
encircle the plaza for her, singing love-songs of appeal
as they went.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<a href='images/p372p.jpg'>
	<img src='images/p372w.jpg'
	title='Things Known and Never Told' alt='Things Known and Never Told' />
</a>
<p>&ldquo;Things Known and Never Told&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The white gleam of the brocaded gown caught the
eyes of the singers, and then a great cry went up
in the night, and the music of the dance ceased,
and the people crowded about the dead woman on the
altar steps, and the old Indios crossed themselves,
and said in their own tongue:</p>

<p>"It has come, after all,&mdash;the sacrifice of blood on
the altar of the temple,&mdash;the thing our fathers told
us has come to pass."</p>

<p>The strings of pearls and other jewels were
scattered on the diamond-shaped tiles of the floor,
and many were red with blood.</p>

<p>"Some one has tried to steal the jewels while we
all danced there," suggested one of the guests, "and
she has died defending them. Rafael, she has given
her life to save the jewels of your wife!"</p>

<p>"Yes," Rafael said, at last, and stared at the speaker
in a dazed way; "my wife. I&mdash;I will go to my wife."</p>

<p>He strode through the crowd toward the living-rooms,
and flung wide the door of her chamber. She
was on her knees where Padre Libertad had left her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
"Raquel!"</p>

<p>His voice sounded hollow and strange in his own
ears. A strange buzzing in his head blurred speech
and thought, and when she arose and faced him with
clear eyes and quiet face, he leaned against the chair
and looked at her strangely&mdash;helplessly.</p>

<p>"She is dead," he said, thickly; "Angela Bryton
is found dead&mdash;and your jewels&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait," she said, "and I will go with you."</p>

<p>And turning, she lifted the lid from the perfumed
box of candles.</p>

<p>"She did not believe in these," she said, quietly,
"but we will light them for her, just the same. None
of us knew whom they would burn for; perhaps she
knows now, Rafael."</p>

<p>He made no answer, but moved like a man stunned
mentally. Out beside her he walked to the altar-place,
and the people made way for them.</p>

<p>It was the hour of dawn when a fisherman rode
from the beach to tell how he had found two sailors
beaten and bound at the landing-place. They had
a story of a sailing-vessel and sacks of coin, and a
bearded man who looked like El Capitan; but it must
have been his ghost, for it was thought Capitan was
dead, as well as Juan Flores. At any rate, the vessel
was gone, and the sailors were left tied on the shore.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
They were afraid to face Rafael Arteaga, because
of the coin he had trusted them with, and the good
boat, gone now straight out of sight&mdash;the saints and
the devil only knew where!</p>

<p>But they needed not to fear Rafael. The coin,
for which he had exchanged all the cattle and horses
possible to sell in two days' time, was a forgotten
thing to him, or uncared for. He sat apart and silent,
as though paralyzed by a great fear, and he ever followed
Raquel Arteaga with his eyes, and said nothing.</p>

<p>The people wondered much that the robbers who
would kill a woman and steal a boat had not stopped
also to gather up the scattered jewels strewn about
her. But they had not. Not even a diamond was
missing. They were gathered from the tiles, and the
blood was washed from them, and the casket was taken
to Raquel by Ana, who was almost as silent as Rafael.
On that subject, never in their lives would they gain
courage to speak. Raquel took the casket, and looked
at the gems, but did not touch them.</p>

<p>"And for such trifles she lost her life, perhaps her
soul&mdash;who knows?" she said, in the same colorless
quiet way, and handed the casket to her husband.
"Rafael, have these put away for her child, when
she becomes a woman. They were paid for by
the mother!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
From that night Rafael Arteaga was a changed man.
Some said he had gone mad at the death of the
woman there; others said that it was not the death of
the woman, but the curse of the Arteagas had fallen
upon him. No one ever heard him laugh or sing
again; and when his wife brought pretty Marta's
little boy from the willows, and had him educated
to inherit after his father, the father accepted him
almost without notice.</p>

<p>Keith Bryton never came back. Letters concerning
the child of Doña Angela were exchanged with Don
Eduardo, who remained her guardian, and after that
there were long years of silence. Only one man, far
down the coast of South America, guessed what
Raquel Arteaga lived through. Even to Ana, who
had left her own land to join him, there were some
things known to him of the old Mission days, and
never told.</p>

<p>Raquel knelt no more at the
shrine of the Madalena, but
she went there nightly as the
afterglow flooded the valley.
Sometimes she rode her horse
alone up the dusk shadows of
Trabuco, past the portal of the
aliso tree and into the inner court of memory. But
always she kept the tryst of the first star of nightfall.</p>

<p>When the years of the great war of the East came,
she knew he was there. And when, after a battle
called "Chickamauga," there came a tiny package
from that far-away place, she stood in the dusk of the
old temple, and slipped the ring of the Aztec eagle
again on her finger. Then she knew that the end
of the separation had come.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"If it were any other woman than you, Raquel
Arteaga, men would say you rode to meet a lover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
when you gallop like that in the night, and come back
looking as if you had just been kissed," said Teresa,
with watchful malice. "The old Indios say that you
bathe in the night dews as a charm to keep young
always. But why do you ride alone?"</p>

<p>"Alone?" The woman who the old courtier had
said held the opal fires of Mexico in her heart smiled
on her sister-in-law at that question, and the dusk
shadows of night and mystery were in her violet
eyes. "I am never alone now, Teresa. It is a
long time since I felt alone, a very long time."</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
